In the [last
post](https://amindforlanguage.com/greek/2023/02/08/dirivational-morph.html)
we discussed noun forming morphology. This post focuses on morphemes
that form verbs.

There are 28,056 verbs in the GNT that represent 1,853 lexical items. Of
these, 425 only occur once.

The table below shows how many lexical items in the GNT are formed using
a given suffix and how many times that verb occurs in the GNT.

  **Suffix**   **Lemmas**   **Occurrences**   **Hapax**
  ------------ ------------ ----------------- -----------
  έω           334          3867              115
  άω           91           1483              28
  όω           88           551               27
  ζω           225          1594              82
  ίζω          130          842               48
  άζω          85           618               29
  εύω          75           668               36
  πτω          57           404               18
  σσω          41           308               12
  λλω          39           676               11
  αίνω         30           354               6
  νυμι         30           138               7
  σκω          28           769               6

By looking at the table we can see that *-εω* forms 334 of the 1,853
lexemes in the GNT, thought 115 of these occur only once. This makes it
a helpful suffix to know as it will help us guess the meaning of
uncommon vocabulary. The same can be said of other morphemes as well.

The list below seems to be the most helpful for the learner since Smythe
and Wiktionary do not give a specific meaning to the others that would
help learners.

[Smythe\'s
grammar](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0007:smythp=866)
notes the following about these suffixes:

-   *-εω* are often intransitive and describe a \"condition or an
    activity\".

-   *-αω* verbs express \"to do, to be, or to have, that which is
    expressed by the stem.\"

-   *-οω* verbs often express \"to causes or to make\".

-   *-ιζω* and *-ιαζω* verbs express \"an adoption of language, manners,
    opinions, or politics\"

-   *-αινω* verbs *seem* to express \"to cause X to be Y\" looking at
    the examples given by Smythe. Smythe gives, but he does not make
    that statement. Take this with a grain of salt.

-   (Wiktionary) says that
    [*-ευω*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-%CE%B5%CF%8D%CF%89#Ancient_Greek)
    verbs are usually added to nouns and mean either indicate that the
    subject is the noun does the usual activity of the noun.
