I began learning Koine Greek from a book when I was 16 or so
(2004-2005).

I made little progress.

**Then, I audited in a seminary class, that used that same book. I was
homeschooled and had the freedom to do stuff like that. Don\'t judge.**

It was a traditional grammar/translation class with lots of memorization
and decoding.

*Not what I\'d recommend today.*

I think I got around a 90 for my grade and liked it a lot better than
the Spanish I\'d had in elementary school.

I took another semester.

**These classes gave me an overview of Greek and some common vocab.**

But, they didn\'t give me a language learning strategy or tools besides
flashcards.

After that I didn\'t take another Greek class until college when I took
Greek 1 distance ed to knock out a requirement so I could graduate
sooner. I had taken some general linguistics, which I applied to my
studies, but really didn\'t learn much.

**After that I focused on modern languages and linguistics research, so
Greek sat on the shelf until 2016 when it became part of my work life.**

Then I got serious.

**I had learned about memory palaces and so I applied them to Metzger\'s
[Lexical Aids for Students of New Testament
Greek](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/682341) and tried to
memorize vocab.**

It helped somewhat, but I still forget the distinction between prefixed
verbs like πρόσεχω and σύνεχω. I think this was mostly a waste of time,
but at least I was doing something.

**The big thing is that I read a fair bit of Greek and looked up grammar
as needed so I was getting comprehensible input (CI) during this time.**

The grammar I read helped make things more comprehensible.

**Other things that happened during this period:**

-   I started reading some Greek linguistics (like [Rouse](https://www.logos.com/product/4599/discourse-grammar-of-the-greek-new-testament-a-practical-introduction-for-teaching-and-exegesis), [Aubrey et al.](https://www.logos.com/product/129137/linguistics-and-biblical-exegesis))
-   I found [James Tauber](https://jktauber.com/) and [Seumas Macdonald](https://thepatrologist.com/)'s work
-   I read Athanaze vol. 1-2 and started JACT\'s [Reading Greek](https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Greek-Association-Classical-Teachers/dp/0521698510).

(I bought the JACT book on Kindle. Not a good format for it.)

More CI.

**I took a few classes with Seumas and even taught a Greek class for
free to acquaintances interested in studying using comprehension focused
methods.**

More CI.

**I tried to read texts outside the GNT, like the church fathers, and
got involved in digitizing Greek texts with the [Greek Leaner Texts
Project](https://greek-learner-texts.org/).**

Kind of funny that I was trying to lemmatize texts that I couldn\'t
read, but I have some programming skills and wanted to make these texts
more comprehensible so I _could eventually_ read them.

What about now?

**Now, I focus on reading.**

I read GNT and LXX. Sometimes I listen to audio while I read, sometimes
not. I want to read Homer and other classical texts.

I also write and try to figure out how to say things for classes I\'m
teaching.

My Greek journey started in the traditional way, but it was the CI bits
that built confidence and skill. The most useful grammar studies
happened along the way as I worked with texts or tried to figure out how
to say (or write) something.
