As I'm learning to talk about Greek in Greek, I find these to be useful. 

The first is Dionysios Thrax's grammar with Alpheios Reading tools and English translation as diglot. This is where I'm learning which words to use and how to use them.

The second two links are tools I've made. I find them helpful for finding words and word forms that I need. 

The paradigm tool is useful for figuring out how to use a word that I find in Thrax, but need it in a different form.
