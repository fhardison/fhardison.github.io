&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://amindforlanguage.com/images/womanDede.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahasa Indonesia is very similar to Bahasa Malaysia (think Spanish and Portuguese, but even more closely related). This post will offer thoughts on how to learn it well, even if you don't live in Indonesia or Southeast Asia (SEA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Don't get hung up on the grammar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian and Malay languages in general have maddeningly complex derivational morphology (i.e. how words are built). They have relative little inflectional morphology (i.e. how they change once they're in a sentence). So, don't try to figure it out, just learn the words and how to use them. You'll notice some general patterns along the way, just don't rely on them 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus once you know &lt;em&gt;kelupaan&lt;/em&gt; ('forgotten'), you don't need to know that the root is &lt;em&gt;lupa&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;ke- -an&lt;/em&gt; is a circumfix (think: suffix + affix). You can just learn it and use it. The reason to ignore this morphology is because &lt;em&gt;it's not predictable&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Kelupaan&lt;/em&gt; is a verb, but &lt;em&gt;keadilan&lt;/em&gt; 'justice' (&lt;em&gt;adil&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;ke- -an&lt;/em&gt;) is an abstract noun. Pengajaran 'teaching' (&lt;em&gt;peng-&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;ajar&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;-an&lt;/em&gt;) is 'teaching', but &lt;em&gt;pengadilan&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;peng-&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;adil&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;-an&lt;/em&gt;) is a 'court of law'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malay languages tend to mark the difference between active and passive verbs. Active verbs usually start with &lt;em&gt;meN-&lt;/em&gt; (N changes depending on sound following it, &lt;em&gt;mengajar&lt;/em&gt; 'to teach') and passive verbs start with &lt;em&gt;di-&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;diajar&lt;/em&gt; 'to be taught'). This is basically the only time verbs change. They don't have to agree with subjects or objects (like in Spanish and English).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahasa Indonesia's word order is basically the same as in English: Subject + Verb + Object. But it's a lot more flexible. There are no articles(words like &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;a/an&lt;/em&gt;) and auxiliary and modal verbs just stack in front of the main verb without words having to change form (usually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Indonesian is primarily a vocabulary problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea though the grammar is not that complicated, the vocabulary is almost totally foreigh, unless you speak Dutch, Arabic, or Sanskrit. There are some English loan words for things related to technology, but basically there aren't many cognates. This will be the primary challenge in Indonesian. How can you remember vocabulary that simply doesn't sound like things we are used to hearing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest memory techniques and a good SRS app (Anki, Flashcards Deluxe, etc). The mnemonics help make new words memorable and the SRS app helps you review so you don't forget them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Find a speaking partner online&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really aren't that many Indonesians living in the USA and they tend to be in major cities. I lived in Chicago about 8 blocks from an Indonesian consulate, but there were still less than 2,000 in the whole Chicagoland area. So unless you are in a place like Washington DC, New York, or LA, then your best bet is to look on a language exchange website or app. Good places to start are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://italki.com"&gt;iTalki.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.speaky.com/"&gt;Speaky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hellotalk.com/?lang=en"&gt;HelloTalk&lt;/a&gt; which is available for Android and iOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Indonesians want to learn English so it's not too hard to find someone who is willing to have a language exchange or chat. Indonesians are also big users of Facebook, WhatsApp, and other social media platforms so you could look there also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want a face-to-face interaction, you might try looking for university students. Many Indonesians come to the United States to study, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. If you live near a university, you might ask the international affairs or students affairs office and see if they can help you. Students are away from home and honestly most Americans aren't very welcoming to foreign students. They would probably love to build a friendship and help you with your Indonesian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Finding interesting content to read&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to read Wikipedia articles in Bahasa Indonesia when I first started learning it. I'd look up a topic that I was interested in (like coffee) and then read the Indonesian version. There are also a lot of blogs and plenty of news websites like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://majalah.tempo.co/"&gt;Tempo&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best Indonesian news magazines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tribunnews.com/"&gt;Tribune News&lt;/a&gt; is also available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Indonesian cities have their own newspapers (called &lt;em&gt;koran&lt;/em&gt;). if you search "koran " + the name of your city or region of interest, you will probably find some local newspapers. The image below shows the Google search results for "koran jawa timur" (East Java).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://amindforlanguage.com/images/koranJawaTimur.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also find ebooks on the following sites (I've never used them):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bukupedia.com/id/main-catalog/id-30/E-book.html"&gt;Buku pedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ebooks.gramedia.com/"&gt;Gramedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Dictionary apps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are a few dictionary apps that I've used. I should also add Google Translate. It's pretty good for single words. I'd still probably prefer one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dridev.kamusku&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Kamusku&lt;/a&gt; for English &amp;gt;&amp;lt; Indonesian translation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yuku.kbbi5&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. This is great once you are ready to start using a monolingual dictionary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to update this page as I hear of new tools or tips so check back periodically for more tips.&lt;/p&gt;
