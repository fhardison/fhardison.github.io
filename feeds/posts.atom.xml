&lt;p&gt;Once there was a man named &lt;em&gt;Sydney&lt;/em&gt; (ς) who was very fond of &lt;em&gt;Women&lt;/em&gt; and felt threatened by other men so that he had his poor dog &lt;em&gt;Neutered&lt;/em&gt; so there was &lt;em&gt;No Chance&lt;/em&gt; (-) of the dog getting in his way. Sydney and his dog were very fond of devices with Apple &lt;em&gt;OS&lt;/em&gt; (-ος, -ος) such that his dog had his own iPhone. They would set together on their &lt;em&gt;iPhones&lt;/em&gt; (-ι) watching &lt;em&gt;ET&lt;/em&gt; (-ι). One day Sydney had an &lt;em&gt;AHA&lt;/em&gt; (-α) moment and realized his life was going  &lt;em&gt;Nowhere&lt;/em&gt; (-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he went to &lt;em&gt;Express&lt;/em&gt; (-ες) and bought some new clothes to make himself very &lt;em&gt;Attractive&lt;/em&gt; (-α). Now that he &lt;em&gt;Owned&lt;/em&gt; (-ων) new clothes he thought it was a &lt;em&gt;Sin&lt;/em&gt; (-σιν) to go out in the old ones so he gave them to his neighbor who was an &lt;em&gt;Attractive&lt;/em&gt; (-α) &lt;em&gt;Astrologer&lt;/em&gt; (-ας).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category></entry><entry><title>Translators' work -- a poem</title><link href="/translators-work-a-poem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Fletcher Hardison</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-01-17:/translators-work-a-poem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been reading &lt;a href="https://store.rabbitroom.com/products/adorning-the-dark-thoughts-on-community-calling-and-the-mystery-of-making?variant=30320112566359"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adorning the Dark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.andrew-peterson.com/"&gt;Andrew Peterson&lt;/a&gt; and it's got me thinking about poetry.

Sometimes you are looking at a word and wondering what on earth it means. Then it turns out that you know this word quite well, but couldn't tell what the root was because half of the letters were missing. They had contracted with various prefixes and suffixes leaving us scratching our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the vowel contraction rules makes life much easier. This is the first post in a comic series to help make learning these rules easier and more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an ε gets added before an α  they contract and form η. We can symbolize this as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ε + a &amp;rarr; η&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who wants to memorize boring rules! It's much better as a story! Since ε and η are considered each other's short and long variant, let's consider them to be brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Once upon a time in Greekland&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day ε is playing on the playground and α comes up and starts teasing him. So ε calls his big brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/assets/ea-contraction-1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big brother η shows up and promptly pounds α while ε flees to safety leaving η to stand victoriously&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category></entry></feed>
