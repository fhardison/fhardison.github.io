&lt;p&gt;... and doesn't have near the resources available as do Greek, Hebrew, or Latin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that this series of posts will help throw some light on how to learn it by describing my experience as I'm doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this an experiment and a test to see if some of the techniques that I have found effective with Koine Greek work for another ancient language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Principles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the principles that guide how I'm going to go about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input over grammar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/05/16/anki-cloze-tables.html"&gt;Cloze grammar cards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/06/10/spaced-reading.html"&gt;Spaced, repeated reading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Input over grammar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, time spent reading &lt;em&gt;Syriac&lt;/em&gt; will be more effective than time spent reading &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; Syriac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as what I'm reading is qualifies as &lt;em&gt;comprehensible input&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. at least 95% understandable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with classical languages is finding material that qualifies as comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I'm a beginner, my plan is to start by adding the sentences from my text book to an &lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; flashcard deck. I'll make sure that I understand the translation of these sentences before I add them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Syriac writing system is quite different from what I'm used to and has a lot of silent letters. I'm going to include a rough phonetic transcription on the back of each card along with the translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another trick I learned is to bold new vocabulary that you want to learn. This will be more useful after I'm more comfortable reading and don't need a full translation on each card. At that point, I'll stop adding full translations and just note the meaning of the bolded words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloze grammar cards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details see &lt;a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/05/16/anki-cloze-tables.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is to use cloze deletions to become more familiar with the paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seem to work really well for me to become comfortable with how a paradigm works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in tension with the &lt;code&gt;input over grammar&lt;/code&gt; principle above, but I find such &lt;em&gt;familarity&lt;/em&gt; to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, not memorizing to memorize, but familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spaced, repeated reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/06/10/spaced-reading.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short the idea is to use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition"&gt;spaced repetition&lt;/a&gt; to schedule rereading material that qualifies as comprehensible input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is accomplished by using a spaced repetition software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me this is Anki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, the cards will simple be the sentences from my textbooks. Once I'm more comfortable, then the cards will probably be links, book + page numbers, or references to the material that I want to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What's next&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write other posts about learning Syriac, I'll add links to them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each review, strengthens the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Comprehensible input&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language, though, is learned through interaction with material that is at least ~95% comprehensible, rather than like a collection of facts to memorize. This can happen via reading, listening, conversations etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a lot of input for the brain to acquire language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's simply how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Greek, this means lots of reading (it is a classical language after all), but reading at or near one's current level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeated exposure to comprehensible input, allows out brain to acquire the words and grammar in that input naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we need &lt;em&gt;repeated&lt;/em&gt; exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could we perhaps combine spaced repetition with reading of comprehensible input to get the needed repetition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to combine them&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's how I've done this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two decks. One for shorter sentences that have words that I specifically want to learn. A second deck that just has the "address" of what I want to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first deck, I make a card with the sentence I want to review and bold the words I want to learn. Then I put the meanings of the new words on the back of the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second deck, I make a card that tells me what to read. I don't put anything else on these cards. For example, I have some cards that say &lt;code&gt;I Clem 17&lt;/code&gt; (1st Clement, chapter 17) or &lt;code&gt;Rom 6&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;I Clem 20:1-3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second deck takes much more time to review and I need access to the books I'm reading. The first deck I can study on the go or whenever I have a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second deck, I'd recommend creating cards with smaller chunks of text to read. So instead of a card that says &lt;code&gt;I John 1&lt;/code&gt;, you might consider &lt;code&gt;I John 1:1-4&lt;/code&gt; and then making other cards for the rest of the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that you don't need as much time to reread the material  and are more likely to keep at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course, you don't need a spaced repetition app to do this.&lt;/em&gt; The idea is simply to &lt;em&gt;read and reread&lt;/em&gt; the same texts. This let's you learn grammar and vocab in a natural way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is finding texts to read that are level appropriate, but that is a can of worms for another post ... or Ph.D. dissertation ;-).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="method"></category><category term="method"></category><category term="anki"></category><category term="reading"></category></entry><entry><title>Anki cloze cards for learning paradigms</title><link href="/anki-cloze-cards-for-learning-paradigms.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-05-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Fletcher Hardison</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-05-16:/anki-cloze-cards-for-learning-paradigms.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Comprehensible input is the way to go.

The research in second language acquisition indicates that consciously memorized knowledge can't morph into facility with a language in the brain. The brain builds its own black-box model of a language through our interaction with it. This process relies on &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of what we read or hear, not on understanding the grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, having familiarity with the paradigms and tables &lt;em&gt;helps&lt;/em&gt; figure out what an unfamiliar form in the text it. At least it helps me think through whether this is a new form or a completely new word. This in turns helps make unfamiliar things more understandable. This increasing my ability to understand is the pay off, not the conscious knowledge of the grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memorizing tables is a pain and is probably not worth too much effort. Familiarity, however, has been helpful to me. The following is a method to use &lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; (free, SRS flashcard software) and cloze deletion flashcards to help with this process of building familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is a cloze card?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cloze card is a flashcard where the piece of information to be learned it blanked out or deleted. This blanked out info is called a "cloze deletion". When studying our task is to recall the missing piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brain remembers things better if we can form associations between the new information and other things that we know. The more connections, the stronger the memory and the easier the recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of trying to memorize and recall a whole paradigm, I propose that we use cloze deletions and blank out only a few pieces of the paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage is that we are only asking ourselves to recall a few forms at a time. This lowers our stress and makes our minds more open to receiving the information. Also we are seeing the other forms on the table and thus seeing the connections between the current form and the rest of the paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example if we wanted to learn or become familiar with the following paradigm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="one"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr class="header"&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Masc&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Fem&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Neut&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;NOM SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;εῖς&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μία&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;έν&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="even"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;GEN SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενός&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μιᾶς&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενός&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;DAT SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενί&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μιᾷ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενί&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="even"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ACC SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ένα&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μίαν&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;έν&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could create cloze cards as follows in order to learn the Masc and Neut, NOM SG forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="one"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr class="header"&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Masc&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Fem&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Neut&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;NOM SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;[...]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μία&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;[...]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="even"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;GEN SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενός&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μιᾶς&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενός&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;DAT SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενί&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μιᾷ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενί&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="even"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ACC SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ένα&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μίαν&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;έν&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the following could be used for the Masc and Neut Gen SG forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="one"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr class="header"&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Masc&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Fem&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Neut&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;NOM SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;εῖς&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μία&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;έν&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="even"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;GEN SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;[...]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μιᾶς&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;[...]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;DAT SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενί&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μιᾷ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενί&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="even"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ACC SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ένα&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μίαν&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;έν&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the following to learn the Fem, Gen SG form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="one"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr class="header"&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Masc&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Fem&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style="text-align: left;"&gt;Neut&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;NOM SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;εῖς&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;[...]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;έν&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="even"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;GEN SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενός&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μιᾶς&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενός&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;DAT SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενί&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μιᾷ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ενί&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="even"&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ACC SG&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;ένα&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;μίαν&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: left;"&gt;έν&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could proceed by adding cloze deletions for the other pieces of the paradigm that we want to recall. Note that it may not be necessary to create a cloze deletion for every piece of the table. Remember that the goal is familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Creating tables in Anki&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki includes a cloze deletion card type. The trick is the table. You can either use spaces or tabs to format the table manually or you can use HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spaces and tabs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaces and tables would be the simplest, but the result may not look as nice. You have to manually line up the columns. I the result would be as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="n"&gt;Masc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Fem&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;Neut&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;NOM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;εῖς&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="err"&gt;μία&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="err"&gt;έν&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;GEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;ενός&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;μιᾶς&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;ενός&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;DAT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;ενί&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="err"&gt;μιᾷ&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="err"&gt;ενί&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ACC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;ένα&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="err"&gt;μίαν&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;έν&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;HTML tables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following instruction assume you are using the Desktop version of Anki to create the cards. Once you sync your collection to your phone, you can view the html tables there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either you have to write the HTML manually, or you can use an HTML table generator such as &lt;a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables"&gt;tablesgenerator.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your html code, click &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; to add a card. Select the cloze card type. Then click on the field under the label &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;. After that, click on the three horizontal bars on the right size of the formatting bar. After that select &lt;code&gt;Edit HTML&lt;/code&gt; or hit &lt;code&gt;CTRL + SHIFT + X&lt;/code&gt; then paste the html code into the pop-up and click &lt;code&gt;close&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Creating the cloze deletions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following assume the desktop app, but the process is very similar for creating cloze deletions on the mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a cloze deletion, you first select the text you want to turn into recall and click on the button &lt;code&gt;[...]&lt;/code&gt; button on the format bar or hit &lt;code&gt;CTRL + SHIFT + C&lt;/code&gt;. This will wrap the info in a cloze code that looks like &lt;code&gt;{{c1::info to be learned}}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create multiple cloze deletions per card. &lt;code&gt;c1&lt;/code&gt; will be the first, then &lt;code&gt;c2&lt;/code&gt; will be the second, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have multiple pieces of the table blanked out at the same time, edit the number following the &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; so they that they are the same. For example, if I wanted 'εν' and 'λογος' to be cloze deletions at the same time, I need to manually edit the number following the &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; so that it looks like &lt;code&gt;{{c1::εν}} αρχη ην {{c1::ο λογος}}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Below is a simple input task that can be used to introduce new vocabulary. Students are given an item and a card with the name of that item. They are then asked to find out what other students have and if the other students like that item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow students to expand their vocabulary as well as encounter that vocabulary in both nominative and accusative case. This should work for nouns, some participles, and adjectives if used in conjunction with a noun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Prep&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find props, pictures, or other realia that represents the words to be learned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a card that has the Greek word for that object. Make sure to include the article and/or genitive singular of the word so that students can correctly identify what gender it belongs to.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It may also be necessary to give the accusative case depending on students facility in conjugating the given declension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If students are beginners, it may help to give them the sentences they will need to complete this activity (see "Language needed for this activity" below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Setup&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide students into groups if necessary. Ideally one or two vocabulary items per student.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give students a prop and a card with the new vocabulary item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students that they need to learn the name of each object/picture/etc. in their group and whether the person likes it because they will be asked to tell the class this information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After students have found the information, the teacher can pick students from the group to tell the class the objects and if the other student liked the item. This also provides a chance to the teacher to repeat the basic questions "τι έχει ...?" and "ᾶρα αυτῄῳ αρέσει ο/η/τό ___?".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Language needed for this activity&lt;/h1&gt;

This is a pain for students because of the many, many forms a given word can take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One principle of modern language teaching is to "limit" or "shelter" vocabulary. In other words, don't use too many new words in the course of a lesson and don't teach too many words in the course. The corollary to this is usually not to limit grammar. Thus while students may only hear a small number of new words, they hear normal (complex) grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/mark-rasmuson.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my Koine Greek class I have tried to limit the number of vocabulary items. I only add a few new words per lesson, but these words are drawn from each gender: masculine, feminine, and neuter. This gives students a chance to acquire the different declensions and the definite article that goes with them. The trouble is that some of these (quite common) words have stem changes and this adds to what my students have to deal with. Even though this kind of suppletion is common in Greek, I think it is overwhelming for my students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The solution &amp;ndash; maybe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been listening to &lt;a href="http://www.teawithbvp.com/"&gt;Tea with BVP&lt;/a&gt; and their new podcast &lt;a href="https://www.classroomtapas.com/talkinl2"&gt;Talkin' L2 with BVP&lt;/a&gt;. Bill VanPatten (i.e. BVP) notes that paradigms aren't psychologically real. In other words, they don't exist in students' brains. Instead, each form is acquired as a separate word and only after a lot of acquisition has already happened are connections made between forms. BVP also notes that when students want to produce a new form, their brain strips the ending off a word in their mental lexicon and applies it to create the new form (again, no paradigms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinking about this brought me to the realization that I need to consider each form a word to be a separate word for the purpose of limiting vocabulary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/cynthiadelrio.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that this means that I should only introduce three to four forms if one word per lesson. I'd never get anywhere with my students. Rather, I should try to introduce words from the same declension so that students don't have to juggle too many new patterns per lesson. This will help expose them to the same kinds of words and hopefully provide the examples and repetition they need to learn the words and make connection between their various forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In upcoming lessons, I will focus introduce words from the same declension (as much as possible). If these words have a stem change, then I may lower the number of new vocabulary items for that lesson and focus on repetitions of the forms with the stem change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that by considering different forms as separate words and by drawing new vocabulary from the same declension, I can reduce the cognitive overwhelm and increate the ease and speed with which my students acquire new vocabulary and grammar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="teaching"></category></entry><entry><title>Grammar is a resource</title><link href="/grammar-is-a-resource.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-02T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-10-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Fletcher Hardison</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-10-02:/grammar-is-a-resource.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After years of working with and learning languages, I realized something.

&lt;p&gt;This is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After years of working with and learning languages, I realized something. It's nothing profound, but it's something to keep in mind when approaching a new language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Put simply, each language provides resources of grammar and vocabulary to its speakers that they can use to communicate their intended meaning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a shift in viewpoint about what grammar is and what is does for us. Rather than being a horrible obstacle in the road of language learning, it's another resource that we can use to help us communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Examples&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some languages have complex grammar &amp;ndash; verbs have many forms and tenses, nouns change form based on their function in the sentence, etc. Such a language allows speakers to rely on the grammar to communicate a lot of things for which English would use word order or intonation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have huge vocabularies so speakers can choose between different words to communicate fine shades of meaning (e.g. English). Others don't so speakers need to use combinations of words to express these same meanings (i.e. &lt;em&gt;very very large&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;colossal&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some languages have a fine-grained tense system. Take the English sentence, "By October, it will have been going on for three months". This sentence describes a point in the future in which a certain state will have already existed for three months and is most likely ongoing at that future point. So this sentence describes a past that is yet future. Complex huh? The grammar of English allows us to convey a fairly complex idea with paucity of words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Indonesian, there is an adversative verb form that means that something undesirable has happened. For example, compare &lt;em&gt;ter-tinggal&lt;/em&gt;, which means 'left behind', with &lt;em&gt;ke-tinggal-an&lt;/em&gt;, which means 'left behind accidently'. By changing the beginning and ending of the verb, a precise shade of meaning can be communicated. The grammar of Indonesian offers this grammatical form as a communication resource to its speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malay languages don't often have gendered pronouns. This means that the word for he/she in these languages doesn't specify whether the person or thing referred to is male, female, or otherwise. This caused trouble for me when I was invited to a birthday party. I thought the child was a girl and couldn't tell from the child's name. It turned out he was a boy and the Barbie doll I brought was not the right present. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;In sum&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grammar and vocabulary are resources that a language provides to it's speakers as a means to communicate. They provide the tools to make jokes, debate politics, create literature, and just shoot the breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you are facing a language with complex grammar, don't view it as a obstacle or drudgery, but as one of the resources that the language provides so you can convey your message. Sometimes the resources are quite subtle, but they can open up new ways to communicate that might not be possible in your native language.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="theory"></category></entry><entry><title>What makes a good mnemonic image?</title><link href="/what-makes-a-good-mnemonic-image.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-07-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Fletcher Hardison</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-07-13:/what-makes-a-good-mnemonic-image.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What if I told you that a simple, still image can be all you need to create a mnemonic with real sticking power?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that's nuts. You've probably heard that mental images need to be bright, colorful, crazy, perhaps obscene, and fully of action. While I agree that this can work for some people, I don't believe that it is necessary &amp;ndash; or even the most effective &amp;ndash; for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a mnemonist for whom complicated, action filled images don't work. If you feel overwhelmed by having to invent action filled stories for each thing you want to memorize, let me propose an alternative for your consideration that I learned about through Swedish author, teacher, and Grand Master of Memory &lt;a href="http://www.grandmasterofmemory.com/"&gt;Mattias Ribbing&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to everything of Ribbing's that I could find and finally decided to learn to read Swedish so I could read his books. This post is primarily based on his book &lt;a href="https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/vagen-till-mastarminne-forandra-ditt-liv-med-kraftfull-minnestraning-9789172322646"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Way to a Master Memory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Characteristic of a memory friendly image&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of many memory techniques is converting information into an image. Ribbing has his own take on how to do this based on the &lt;a href="http://www.sevensigma.info/articles/4memory.html"&gt;Giordano Memory System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/art-close-up-comic-16516.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He begins with the principle that we can't memorize things in isolation, rather they they need to be connected. So visualizing one image by itself is not helpful. We need to create couplings of images that touch, sit on, or even pierce each other in some way. If you are memorizing texts or foreign language vocabulary, then connecting images makes things easier anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribbing says "To be able to quickly create good couplings [of images], we need to to visualize &lt;em&gt;memory-friendly images&lt;/em&gt;" (clarification added). He sets forth the following criteria for what qualifies as a memory-friendly image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means images of physical objects that we can see in front of us in the room, big, in color, three-dimensional and detailed. The images must also have contours that clearly delimit them from the environment (Ribbing 2011, &lt;em&gt;translation mine&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also adds that we should use the first image that comes to mind that fulfills these criteria. Finally, that image should be &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like a lot, that's ok. It becomes nearly automatic with practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have rephrased his criteria so that they can be remembered with the phrase "TeDDy'S CaFe." Imagine Winnie the Pooh having a coffee in Starbucks or your café of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;hree dimensional&lt;/em&gt;, not flat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;istinct&lt;/em&gt; and has clear contours (sharp angles are a bonus too)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;etailed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;till&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's &lt;em&gt;in &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;olor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;irst image I think up&lt;/em&gt; that has the above characteristics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below is the size of an index card and can be printed and kept with you as a reminder of these principles (a PDF is available &lt;a href="/images/TeDDy_CaFe.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/TeDDy_CaFe.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two final points from Ribbing and my own experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to imagine the image in front of you taking up space.&lt;/strong&gt; This takes some practice but I think it pays off. I often look to where various parts of it would be if it were really in front of me. Ribbing has said in some of his talks that this helps (find out more &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFtPOUx7Hk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e9PxI66tyI"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you visualize an image, take a few seconds to really see it. Notice what details that your mind provides.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if you just imagine a book, your brain is probably thinking of a specific book. So take the time to see what book you are seeing in your mind. Chronicles of Narnia? Lord of the Rings? Oxford English Dictionary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I wanted to use a knight to remember England (I was memorizing World Cup wins at the time). As I paid attention to the details, I realized that I was imagining a crusader knight with a red cross and white tunic over his armor. These details make the image "sticky" mentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Encoding techniques&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking up images can be challenging when we first begin. Ribbing describes three kinds of encoding strategies that we can use to convert information to images. I don't consciously think "Oh, I'm using a symbolic encoding right now," but knowing that these three techniques are solid strategies can give direction when you don't know how to encode something. They can also give you assurance that you are doing things the right way when you have doubts. Doubt is something I think we all experience when learning memory techinques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consonance encoding (&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; sounds like &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbolic encoding (&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is closely associated with &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiential encoding (&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; relates to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; in my personal experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consonance encoding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;consonance encoding&lt;/strong&gt; (think rhyming) we use a similar sounding word to encode the information we want to memorize. Ribbing notes that this is especially useful for learning foreign language vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, to learn the Spanish word &lt;em&gt;casa&lt;/em&gt; 'house', we might use the English word &lt;em&gt;cash&lt;/em&gt; to help remember the pronunciation. So our mental image would be a house made out of cash.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symbolic encoding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this kind of encoding we use a symbol to encode the new information. For example, a heart is often used as a symbol for "love". A flag could be used in place of the country it represents. The idea is to use something closely associated with thing to be remembered as a replacement/stand in for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experiential encoding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With experiential encoding we encode information using a personal connection. For example, I memorized the word &lt;em&gt;Benjaminite&lt;/em&gt; by using an baby blue electric guitar because a good friend of mine whose middle name is Benjamin plays a baby blue Fender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use this technique find something from your experience that helps you remember the new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the technique you choose, the image you create should follow the "TeDDy'S CaFe" principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many memory technique teachers recommend using bright, action-filled stories to convert information into something that can stick in long-term memory. However, that's not the case for all memory teachers. I personally find creating such images difficult and that all the action makes them hard to visualize.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer to use "TeDDy'S CaFe" style images. I find them less stressful to work with and more effective for me. When looking for images, we can encode information using one of three time tested teqniques: rhyming, symbolic association, or by using something from our own experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter where you come down on action filled or still images, the other principles of what makes a memory-friendly (mnemonic) image will help you strengthen your skills as a mnemonist, help you memorize things faster, and remember them for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

It's the national language of Indonesia and is thus the de facto lingua fraca for around 250 million people, though not all of them speak it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/womanDede.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahasa Indonesia is very similar to Bahasa Malaysia (think Spanish and Portuguese, but even more closely related). This post will offer thoughts on how to learn it well, even if you don't live in Indonesia or Southeast Asia (SEA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Don't get hung up on the grammar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian and Malay languages in general have maddeningly complex derivational morphology (i.e. how words are built). They have relative little inflectional morphology (i.e. how they change once they're in a sentence). So, don't try to figure it out, just learn the words and how to use them. You'll notice some general patterns along the way, just don't rely on them 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus once you know &lt;em&gt;kelupaan&lt;/em&gt; ('forgotten'), you don't need to know that the root is &lt;em&gt;lupa&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;ke- -an&lt;/em&gt; is a circumfix (think: suffix + affix). You can just learn it and use it. The reason to ignore this morphology is because &lt;em&gt;it's not predictable&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Kelupaan&lt;/em&gt; is a verb, but &lt;em&gt;keadilan&lt;/em&gt; 'justice' (&lt;em&gt;adil&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;ke- -an&lt;/em&gt;) is an abstract noun. Pengajaran 'teaching' (&lt;em&gt;peng-&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;ajar&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;-an&lt;/em&gt;) is 'teaching', but &lt;em&gt;pengadilan&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;peng-&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;adil&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;-an&lt;/em&gt;) is a 'court of law'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malay languages tend to mark the difference between active and passive verbs. Active verbs usually start with &lt;em&gt;meN-&lt;/em&gt; (N changes depending on sound following it, &lt;em&gt;mengajar&lt;/em&gt; 'to teach') and passive verbs start with &lt;em&gt;di-&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;diajar&lt;/em&gt; 'to be taught'). This is basically the only time verbs change. They don't have to agree with subjects or objects (like in Spanish and English).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahasa Indonesia's word order is basically the same as in English: Subject + Verb + Object. But it's a lot more flexible. There are no articles(words like &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;a/an&lt;/em&gt;) and auxiliary and modal verbs just stack in front of the main verb without words having to change form (usually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Indonesian is primarily a vocabulary problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea though the grammar is not that complicated, the vocabulary is almost totally foreigh, unless you speak Dutch, Arabic, or Sanskrit. There are some English loan words for things related to technology, but basically there aren't many cognates. This will be the primary challenge in Indonesian. How can you remember vocabulary that simply doesn't sound like things we are used to hearing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest memory techniques and a good SRS app (Anki, Flashcards Deluxe, etc). The mnemonics help make new words memorable and the SRS app helps you review so you don't forget them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Find a speaking partner online&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really aren't that many Indonesians living in the USA and they tend to be in major cities. I lived in Chicago about 8 blocks from an Indonesian consulate, but there were still less than 2,000 in the whole Chicagoland area. So unless you are in a place like Washington DC, New York, or LA, then your best bet is to look on a language exchange website or app. Good places to start are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://italki.com"&gt;iTalki.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.speaky.com/"&gt;Speaky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hellotalk.com/?lang=en"&gt;HelloTalk&lt;/a&gt; which is available for Android and iOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Indonesians want to learn English so it's not too hard to find someone who is willing to have a language exchange or chat. Indonesians are also big users of Facebook, WhatsApp, and other social media platforms so you could look there also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want a face-to-face interaction, you might try looking for university students. Many Indonesians come to the United States to study, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. If you live near a university, you might ask the international affairs or students affairs office and see if they can help you. Students are away from home and honestly most Americans aren't very welcoming to foreign students. They would probably love to build a friendship and help you with your Indonesian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Finding interesting content to read&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to read Wikipedia articles in Bahasa Indonesia when I first started learning it. I'd look up a topic that I was interested in (like coffee) and then read the Indonesian version. There are also a lot of blogs and plenty of news websites like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://majalah.tempo.co/"&gt;Tempo&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best Indonesian news magazines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tribunnews.com/"&gt;Tribune News&lt;/a&gt; is also available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Indonesian cities have their own newspapers (called &lt;em&gt;koran&lt;/em&gt;). if you search "koran " + the name of your city or region of interest, you will probably find some local newspapers. The image below shows the Google search results for "koran jawa timur" (East Java).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/koranJawaTimur.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also find ebooks on the following sites (I've never used them):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bukupedia.com/id/main-catalog/id-30/E-book.html"&gt;Buku pedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ebooks.gramedia.com/"&gt;Gramedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Dictionary apps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are a few dictionary apps that I've used. I should also add Google Translate. It's pretty good for single words. I'd still probably prefer one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dridev.kamusku&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Kamusku&lt;/a&gt; for English &amp;gt;&amp;lt; Indonesian translation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yuku.kbbi5&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. This is great once you are ready to start using a monolingual dictionary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We know we use to communicate and that it has words/signs, grammar, sounds, etc. But what is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/web-jingyi-wang-photo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a means of communication and thus implies a message and a means. In linguistics, this pairing of message and means is often called a construction or sign (to use the venerable term coined by De Saussure). Communication is also social; it implies a speaker/writer and a listener/reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's the point of this post. &lt;strong&gt;Language is a network of associations&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;in the brain and between people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never read it put exactly this way in linguistics per se. But I think it's is a good summary of a 2009 paper by the "Five Graces Group" [1] that called language a "Complex Adaptive System" (CAS). This  means that language exists as a group of interacting agents (people/neurons) interacting and it changes and adapts as a result of this interaction. It is complex because there are a lot of agents and it adapts in ways we may not expect. FYI, they Wikipedia page [2] on CASs list the brain as an example of a CAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A social network&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/people-network.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people interact they form a network or system. As they do this, they change and grow. The ways they communicate change and grow too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the impact of social media and text messages have had on language. We interact in type a lot more now. This has spawned new abbreviations and acronyms. Some of which have found their way into spoken language [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our speech individual speech changes as we interact with others. We start to talk like our friends or co-workers. You may start saying new words or changing the way you pronounce them because of a new acquaintance. Language exists as a network of people interacting who affect each other and each other's language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A neural network&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/brain.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is also a CAS that stores and controls our ability to use language. The Graces' paper adopts the view of grammar "in which the cognitive organization of language is based directly on experience with language" (p.5). The way our brain stores and organizes language is based on our experience, not what we have read in grammar textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Graces further state that our brains store language by grouping chunks of language into clusters of related chunks based on their form, meaning, and "the context in which they have been experienced..." (p.7). Instead of having a bunch of rules in our heads, we have a catalogue of chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains why we perceive links between sentences like "I have been doing something" and "I had been doing something". They have almost identical form and only slightly different meaning (their tense/aspect). But we may not frequently see the link between "merry" and "happy". Even though they have similar meanings, they are not used in the same context ("Happy birthday", and "Merry Christmas" (if you're American), but not "Merry Birthday").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a chunk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/chunk.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are these chunks? According to the Graces's paper, these chunks are direct form-meaning pairs known as "constructions". They can be things like idioms, the shape of passive sentence, or something small like a the English past tense suffix &lt;em&gt;-ed&lt;/em&gt; (p. 5). An individual word is a construction. So is a phrase or idiom. So are things that we would normally think of as "grammar" like the pattern of an active or passive sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Essentially constructions can be any meaningful chunk of language.&lt;/em&gt; The brain perceives them and then groups them with other similar constructions based on form, meaning, and context. The more chunks that we experience, the more the brain has to work with. It categories them and our grammar, even of our own languages, changes based on our experience using the language and interacting with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Graces' paper says that when we learn a new language our brains store new constructions and refines its groupings and understanding of these constructions over time. Our understanding of a construction in our new language is "sensitive" to how often we are exposed to it, how recently we were exposed to it, and context (presumably the one in which we encounter it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/takeaway.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for us as language learners? Here are a few thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn in chunks and add them to your network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Grace's paper did not said that we have to understand every detail of a construction or chunk to begin using it. Learning new chunks is an iterative process as our brains group and regroup the chunks it encounters. If you don't understand the detail of a chunk, just learn it as a unit and start using it. IT becomes part of your mental network and your brain will sort out the details as you go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By learning the chunk as a unit first, you can keep making progress in the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the Graces' paper also notes that explicit instruction can help if the thing being taught helps us understand what the chunk means. So if we're having trouble with some new chunk, explicit study of grammar &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; help if it helps us understand the meaning. The meaning is the important part, nor the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We need people too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language is a network that exists between you and other speakers/users of the language. Interacting with and hearing others speak is how we learned our first language. Don't forget to interact with others. Relationships are what make life rich and these interactions can really help your language skills develop quickly. Speaking with others trains your speaking and listening skills all at the same time. And it's fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We need input and repeated exposure to stuff we understand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains form their network of chunks based on experience. So we need a lot of exposure to our new language so that our brains can grow their network. The more chunks we are exposed to the more our brain has to work with. Recall that a construction or chunk is a form-meaning pair. If we don't understand, then we only the the form, but not the meaning. Thus the chunk is defective and probably won't help us. It may cause stress and confusion when we come to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensible input is generally defined as input that is 92-95% comprehensible. When we don't understand something, it creates stress and can quickly become noise that our brain filters out. This means we need to (try to) pick things that are comprehensible. If we don't have comprehensible material available, then we need to try to make it that way. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chunks can be anything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chunks exist on many levels of a language: sentence structure, verb forms, idioms, phrases, etc. So if we find something that we think will be useful, we should play with it, add it to your flashcards, and practice it. There is no reason to say that we &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; learn single words or that everything &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be in a sentence or phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We should practice and play with chunks repeatedly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repetition is key to telling our brains that something is important. So say the memory experts. By practicing and playing with a chunk, we giving our brain new chances to categorize it and making it easier to recall when we need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;em&gt;playing&lt;/em&gt;, I mean swapping bits of the chunk for other words or chunks. Making "He was seen by me" into "She was seen by me" and then "She was hit by the car" etc. This &lt;em&gt;playing&lt;/em&gt; reinforces connections between the construction and other constructions in our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to see the chunk again after a period of time so add it to your SRS app or other review system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We should capitalize on associations.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Graces' paper said that our brain categorizes things based on form, meaning, and context. We can focus on finding associations for three things when we want to learn a new chunk by asking the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the form of the chunk remind us of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the order of this new chunk like the order of one we already know?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is different, if so how?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the meaning remind us of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you think about this idea/concept, what is the first thing that pops into your mind?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you associate it with a movie/TV show? or something that is scary, shocking, funny, or unusual?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How about the context in which we learned it or heard it most recently? Can we associate it with that context somehow? If we read the word in a Sherlock Holmes book can we imagine it wearing a hat and trench coat and smoking a pipe or saying "Elementary my dear Watson"?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Positive language transfer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for a departure from the Graces' paper. We learn by association, and memories are stronger the more associations they have. Because our native language is in our brain, we may as well connect new chunk to it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if we are learning Dutch and know that the Dutch way to say "I like it" is "Ik vind het leuk" (literally "I find it nice"), then why not make this association too. Once we become comfortable using the Dutch phrase, then the association with our native language can fall away. But in the mean time, it provides another link to the Dutch phrase and another way to remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's all a network, working on one part helps keeps the whole thing healthy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows us that we don't learn one piece of language perfectly and then move onto the next part. We learn lots of parts at the same time. No point in beating yourself up if you make a mistake. Move on to other topics and keep trying. Given time and exposure, you'll get better at the thing that is driving you up a wall right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research based on cognitive science and what we know about the brain tells us that language works like a network that adapts and grows as it is used. Not only is it a network between speakers of the language, but it's also stored as a network in our own brains. We can leverage this to learn new languages more efficient and enjoyable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
