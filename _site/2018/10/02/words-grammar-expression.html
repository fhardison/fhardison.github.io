<p>After years of working with and learning languages, I realized something. It’s nothing profound, but it’s something to keep in mind when approaching a new language.</p>

<p><em>Put simply, each language provides resources of grammar and vocabulary to its speakers that they can use to communicate their intended meaning.</em></p>

<p>This is a shift in viewpoint about what grammar is and what is does for us. Rather than being a horrible obstacle in the road of language learning, it’s another resource that we can use to help us communicate.</p>

<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>

<p>Some languages have complex grammar – verbs have many forms and tenses, nouns change form based on their function in the sentence, etc. Such a language allows speakers to rely on the grammar to communicate a lot of things for which English would use word order or intonation.</p>

<p>Some have huge vocabularies so speakers can choose between different words to communicate fine shades of meaning (e.g. English). Others don’t so speakers need to use combinations of words to express these same meanings (i.e. <em>very very large</em> vs. <em>colossal</em>).</p>

<p>Some languages have a fine-grained tense system. Take the English sentence, “By October, it will have been going on for three months”. This sentence describes a point in the future in which a certain state will have already existed for three months and is most likely ongoing at that future point. So this sentence describes a past that is yet future. Complex huh? The grammar of English allows us to convey a fairly complex idea with paucity of words.</p>

<p>In Indonesian, there is an adversative verb form that means that something undesirable has happened. For example, compare <em>ter-tinggal</em>, which means ‘left behind’, with <em>ke-tinggal-an</em>, which means ‘left behind accidently’. By changing the beginning and ending of the verb, a precise shade of meaning can be communicated. The grammar of Indonesian offers this grammatical form as a communication resource to its speakers.</p>

<p>Malay languages don’t often have gendered pronouns. This means that the word for he/she in these languages doesn’t specify whether the person or thing referred to is male, female, or otherwise. This caused trouble for me when I was invited to a birthday party. I thought the child was a girl and couldn’t tell from the child’s name. It turned out he was a boy and the Barbie doll I brought was not the right present. Oops.</p>

<h1 id="in-sum">In sum</h1>

<p>Grammar and vocabulary are resources that a language provides to it’s speakers as a means to communicate. They provide the tools to make jokes, debate politics, create literature, and just shoot the breeze.</p>

<p>So next time you are facing a language with complex grammar, don’t view it as a obstacle or drudgery, but as one of the resources that the language provides so you can convey your message. Sometimes the resources are quite subtle, but they can open up new ways to communicate that might not be possible in your native language.</p>
