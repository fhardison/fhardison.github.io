    <p>Ancient/Koine Greek is nothing if not inflected. It is also quite irregular. This is a pain for students because of the many, many forms a given word can take.</p>

<p>One principle of modern language teaching is to “limit” or “shelter” vocabulary. In other words, don’t use too many new words in the course of a lesson and don’t teach too many words in the course. The corollary to this is usually not to limit grammar. Thus while students may only hear a small number of new words, they hear normal (complex) grammar.</p>

<h1 id="the-problem">The problem</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/mark-rasmuson.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In my Koine Greek class I have tried to limit the number of vocabulary items. I only add a few new words per lesson, but these words are drawn from each gender: masculine, feminine, and neuter. This gives students a chance to acquire the different declensions and the definite article that goes with them. The trouble is that some of these (quite common) words have stem changes and this adds to what my students have to deal with. Even though this kind of suppletion is common in Greek, I think it is overwhelming for my students.</p>

<h1 id="the-solution--maybe">The solution – maybe</h1>

<p>I have been listening to <a href="http://www.teawithbvp.com/">Tea with BVP</a> and their new podcast <a href="https://www.classroomtapas.com/talkinl2">Talkin’ L2 with BVP</a>. Bill VanPatten (i.e. BVP) notes that paradigms aren’t psychologically real. In other words, they don’t exist in students’ brains. Instead, each form is acquired as a separate word and only after a lot of acquisition has already happened are connections made between forms. BVP also notes that when students want to produce a new form, their brain strips the ending off a word in their mental lexicon and applies it to create the new form (again, no paradigms).</p>

<p><em>Thinking about this brought me to the realization that I need to consider each form a word to be a separate word for the purpose of limiting vocabulary.</em></p>

<h1 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h1>

<p><img src="/assets/cynthiadelrio.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I don’t think that this means that I should only introduce three to four forms if one word per lesson. I’d never get anywhere with my students. Rather, I should try to introduce words from the same declension so that students don’t have to juggle too many new patterns per lesson. This will help expose them to the same kinds of words and hopefully provide the examples and repetition they need to learn the words and make connection between their various forms.</p>

<p>In upcoming lessons, I will focus introduce words from the same declension (as much as possible). If these words have a stem change, then I may lower the number of new vocabulary items for that lesson and focus on repetitions of the forms with the stem change.</p>

<p>My hope is that by considering different forms as separate words and by drawing new vocabulary from the same declension, I can reduce the cognitive overwhelm and increate the ease and speed with which my students acquire new vocabulary and grammar.</p>
