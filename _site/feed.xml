I tried <span
class="citation" data-cites="SHE2005">@SHE2005</span> and find it to be
useful, but not as easy as Pharr<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"><span class="citation"
data-cites="pharr1920">@pharr1920</span><br />
<br />
</span></span>.</p>
<p>The thing that makes Pharr so nice to work with is that the
vocabulary in each chapter is directly tied to exercises and the
extracts from the Iliad. Also, the exercises are quite often simplified
versions of the iliad extract, and even if they are not, they include
vocabulary or forms that are soon to be found in said extracts. As Crane
points out, Pharr’s book is centered around getting learners to the
point that they can read book 1 of the Iliad.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"><span class="citation"
data-cites="crane2022">@crane2022</span><br />
<br />
</span></span>.</p>
<p>Thus, the vocabulary lists, exercises, and and Iliad extracts build
upon one another and conspire to provide the learner with a fair amount
of repetition while also actually reading an authentic Greek text that
students would likely be interested in reading.</p>
<section id="srs-flashcards" class="level1">
<h1>SRS flashcards</h1>
<p>I have also been pondering the place of SRS flashcards<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Spaced Repetition Software based flashcards<br />
<br />
</span></span> in this process. One of the shortfalls of flashcards is
that they don’t provide repeated exposure to words in different
contexts. If they are not made properly, the the student can simply
learn the card rather than the linguistic chunk intended.</p>
<p>However, combining an SRS tool, such as Anki<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote"><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"
class="uri">https://apps.ankiweb.net/</a><br />
<br />
</span></span>, with the carefully crafted exercises from a textbook
like Pharr could help avoid these pitfalls.</p>
<p>At this point, I have two anki decks that I update each chapter as I
work my way trough Pharr. One is a deck of vocabulary and the second
deck contains the Greek exercises and Iliad extracts. Anki allows HTML
in flashcards so it is simple to use <code>&lt; br/&gt;</code> to add
the poety from the Iliad and maintain the line breaks. I add the
relevant sections from Pharr into their corresponding decks and then
review them.</p>
<p>Since Anki syncs from desktop to phone, I add new content to the
decks on my laptop and sync it to my phone for review.</p>
</section>
<section id="thoughts-on-nt-greek" class="level1">
<h1>Thoughts on NT Greek</h1>
<p>I think the above method is proving helpful because of the quality of
Pharr’s textbook. I have real doubts about using it with other books.
For example, my first exposure to New Testament Greek was through
Mounce’s grammar!sidenote(bibliographical info).</p>
<p>If memory serves, Mounce supplies exercises from the NT as soon as
possible based on the points and vocabulary covered in the Grammar. This
is similar to Pharr. The difference, however, is that Mounce is not
building toward anything. Pharr is building to reading Iliad book 1 so
his exercises are built around the next section of the Iliad to be read.
This means that there is story and context for the vocabulary and
exercises. This was not the case with Mounce.</p>
<p>I suspect that there are other GNT textbooks available that are
orientented toward reading a particular book of the GNT (or perhaps LXX)
and I think this is a good thing. The use of “textbook Greek” and
simplified exercises to get students reading a large and sequentual
chunk of a GNT book would be much more helpful than a collection of
whatever verses happen to exhibit the point of grammar and vocabulary
taught in the chapter.</p>
<p>Some GNT books contain sections that are quite difficult or may
contain a lot of grammar that hasn’t be covered yet. This really isn’t a
problem as these difficulties could either be overcome by footnotes
containing the needed information to understand them, or they could
simply be summarized and/or simplified. This would allow the student to
keep tracking the plot/argument of the GNT book without being overly
bogged down by sections that are two difficult.</p>
<p>Crane rightly points out however that Pharr teaches words that may be
low frequence in the rest of the Homeric corpus because they are needed
for reading Iliad, book 1. But he also points out that with digital
tools, we can easily provide glosses and not require students to learn
these words. The same thing is true for the GNT. While a word may be
important for understanding the GNT book a course is developed around,
it can simply be footnoted if it is not as relevant to the GNT as a
whole.</p>

around reading John’s Gospel. Clyde Pharr’s Homeric Greek textbook
(Pharr 1929) is built around reading Iliad, Book 1 and I think this has
some really helpful features.</p>
<p>The main advantage is that the exercises and readings all center
around a real text to be read and thus maintain a coherent storyline and
set of vocabulary. This approach is skewed in that it teaches for a
particular book, but in my mind the tradeoff is worth it.</p>
<p>That said I was wondering how the how many of the GNT lemmas one
would encounter reading John. In other words, how skewed would such an
approach be. So I clobbed together some code using James Tauber’s
<code>vocabulary tools</code><span

<p>After learning John’s lemmas a learner would know 18.29% of the GNT’s
unique lemmas. Which is not so great.</p>
<p>The picture changes if we look at what percentage of the total words
in the GNT are occurrences of the lemmas in John.</p>
<p>The lemmas that occur in John cover 85.82% of the total of 137,554
lemmas that occur in the GNT. That’s not too shabby.</p>
<p>So after reading John, assuming a learner has a perfect memory, they
should be able to read 85.82% of the words they encounter in the rest of
the GNT.</p>
<p>But what about word forms? How many of the forms of words would a
reader encounter in John?</p>
<p>By reading John a reader would encounter 14.64% of the unique forms
found in the GNT. But these forms account for 74.63% of the 137,554
forms that occur in the GNT.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>By taking these two percentages of lemmas and forms vs total
occurrences in the GNT, it seems that John’s Gospel has a reasonable
amount of high frequency vocabulary and grammar. It seems that a learner
would be in a good place after reading John’s Gospel from whence to
explore the rest of the GNT, especially with the help of a reader’s
edition.</p>
<p>To me this shows that a NT Greek textbook oriented around reading
John’s Gospel would be plausible and valuable for students.</p>
