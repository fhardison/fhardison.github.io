There is an interesting site called Without Vowels project that has a [grammar summary page](https://withoutvowels.org/wiki/Grammar:Quick) for Biblical Hebrew. While I wouldn't say I agree with some of the aims of the site, the idea of studying grammar without vowels in interesting. 

I took the grammar summary and made a single page pdf version (available [here](./no_vowels_chart.pdf) with some edits to make it fit on one page. 

It may not be enough to identify each form precisely, but I think it might be enough to get the gist which is sometimes all we need for extensive reading.
