                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Syriac is a Semitic language in the same family as Aramaic. It also has one of the earliest transitions the New Testament and is a Christian literary language as well.</p>
<p>It's related to the Aramaic that Jesus and the Apostles would have grown up speaking...</p>
<p>... and it's not widely known ...</p>
<p>... and doesn't have near the resources available as do Greek, Hebrew, or Latin.</p>
<p>My hope is that this series of posts will help throw some light on how to learn it by describing my experience as I'm doing just that.</p>
<p>Consider this an experiment and a test to see if some of the techniques that I have found effective with Koine Greek work for another ancient language.</p>
<h1>Principles</h1>
<p>These are some of the principles that guide how I'm going to go about it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Input over grammar</li>
<li><a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/05/16/anki-cloze-tables.html">Cloze grammar cards</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/06/10/spaced-reading.html">Spaced, repeated reading</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Input over grammar</h2>
<p>In other words, time spent reading <em>Syriac</em> will be more effective than time spent reading <em>about</em> Syriac.</p>
<p>As long as what I'm reading is qualifies as <em>comprehensible input</em> (i.e. at least 95% understandable).</p>
<p>The problem with classical languages is finding material that qualifies as comprehensible.</p>
<p>Since I'm a beginner, my plan is to start by adding the sentences from my text book to an <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> flashcard deck. I'll make sure that I understand the translation of these sentences before I add them.</p>
<p>Because the Syriac writing system is quite different from what I'm used to and has a lot of silent letters. I'm going to include a rough phonetic transcription on the back of each card along with the translation.</p>
<p>Another trick I learned is to bold new vocabulary that you want to learn. This will be more useful after I'm more comfortable reading and don't need a full translation on each card. At that point, I'll stop adding full translations and just note the meaning of the bolded words.</p>
<h2>Cloze grammar cards</h2>
<p>For more details see <a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/05/16/anki-cloze-tables.html">this post</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to use cloze deletions to become more familiar with the paradigms.</p>
<p>These seem to work really well for me to become comfortable with how a paradigm works.</p>
<p>This is in tension with the <code>input over grammar</code> principle above, but I find such <em>familarity</em> to be helpful.</p>
<p>Again, not memorizing to memorize, but familiarity.</p>
<h2>Spaced, repeated reading</h2>
<p>See <a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/06/10/spaced-reading.html">this post</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In short the idea is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> to schedule rereading material that qualifies as comprehensible input.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by using a spaced repetition software.</p>
<p>For me this is Anki.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the cards will simple be the sentences from my textbooks. Once I'm more comfortable, then the cards will probably be links, book + page numbers, or references to the material that I want to read.</p>
<h1>What's next</h1>
<p>As I write other posts about learning Syriac, I'll add links to them here.</p>
