I stumbled across [Tony Marsh on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@LanguageMatrix/videos) and later interviewed him on the Greeking Out podcast. his _Question Cards_ video (see "Links" below) intreaged me. Then his method for using ChatGPT to generate language got me thinking. He has a number of helpful videos and thoughts on language learning. 

His idea of focusing on conversation and fluency as the ability to ask and answer questions from reflex makes a lot of sense to me. He notes that fluency isn't knowing all the words, but being able to use what we know fluently. He posed the question of what if one was able to ask and answer 100 questions in a language, wouldn't that person be fluent? 

His videos got me trying out ClaudeAi and Google Gemini to generate open questions, statements, and Yes/No questions in the languages I want to learn. Including, Ancient Greek. 



His videos lead me to this prompt. 


```
I would like you to generate a list of statements and questions like shown in the table below. The first column should be a statement, the second should be a yes/no question, the thrid should be an open question, and the fourth should be an example answer to the open question, and the fifth should be the English translation of the Statement. 

| Statement | Y/N question | Open question | Prompt | English | 
| I am at home | Are you at home? | Where are you? | At home | I am at home | 
| I am at the store | Are you at the store? | Where are you? | At the store  | I am at the store| 
| I am at a restaurant | Are you at a restaruant? | Where are you? | At a restaurant | I am at a restaurant | 

I would like to focus on answering the question, "What do you like to do?" Please genereate 20 questions including these and more that would be suitable for a beginner conversation in Ancient/Koine Greek. Please output them in a csv format as follows "Statement", "Y/N question", "Open Question", "prompt", "English"
```
