I"¾<p>Recently Iâ€™ve wanted to read some Ancient Greek texts with some
additional helps as my currently fluency level requires some support to
reach these texts. Iâ€™ve created a few repos that have Alpheios reading
tools added and a diglot or two (one is even sentence aligned). Here are
the links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amindforlanguage.com/thrax_grammar/">Some Ancient
Greek grammars</a>
<ul>
<li>Art of Grammar by Dionysios Thrax</li>
<li>4 works by Apollonius Dyscolus</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://amindforlanguage.com/anabasis/">Anabasis, Book 1
(Diglot with Alpheios</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amindforlanguage.com/argonautica/">Argonautica,
Book 1 with Alpheios</a></li>
</ul>
