<h1 id="the-rules-of-the-game">The rules of the game</h1>

<p>WAYK is a cooperative learning game, where learners and teachers work together to make leanguage learning fun, easy, and succesfful. The foundation of this game is a group of techniques. According to the <a href="http://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-glossary/#technique">WAYK site</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Techniques, or TQs for short, are the essence of WAYK. TQs are a collection of tested strategies for maximizing the speed, ease, and efficiency of language transfer. Throwing a TQ elicits a specific action or reaction that streamlines learning. Any player (teacher or student, learner or leader) can throw TQs at any time. Signaling Technique provides a time out to make suggestions or discuss how to further the game or improve the interaction. As a community, we have developed TQs for immersion, documentation, classroom management, community organizing, curriculum development, and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve devided the technqiques into groups based on their function in the game our group is playing. You can download a list of the techniques you will want to use in class <a href="/assets/pdf-techniques-handout.pdf">here</a>. Some of the ones listed here are for your information and will be used primarily by the group leader.</p>
