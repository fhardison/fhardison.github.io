I"P<p>Syriac is a Semitic language in the same family as Aramaic. It also has one of the earliest transitions the New Testament and is a Christian literary language as well.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s related to the Aramaic that Jesus and the Apostles would have grown up speakingâ€¦</p>

<p>â€¦ and itâ€™s not widely known â€¦</p>

<p>â€¦ and doesnâ€™t have near the resources available as do Greek, Hebrew, or Latin.</p>

<p>My hope is that this series of posts will help throw some light on how to learn it by describing my experience as Iâ€™m doing just that.</p>

<p>Consider this an experiment and a test to see if some of the techniques that I have found effective with Koine Greek work for another ancient language.</p>

<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>

<p>These are some of the principles that guide how Iâ€™m going to go about it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Input over grammar</li>
  <li><a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/05/16/anki-cloze-tables.html">Cloze grammar cards</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/06/10/spaced-reading.html">Spaced, repeated reading</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="input-over-grammar">Input over grammar</h2>

<p>In other words, time spent reading <em>Syriac</em> will be more effective than time spent reading <em>about</em> Syriac.</p>

<p>As long as what Iâ€™m reading is qualifies as <em>comprehensible input</em> (i.e. at least 95% understandable).</p>

<p>The problem with classical languages is finding material that qualifies as comprehensible.</p>

<p>Since Iâ€™m a beginner, my plan is to start by adding the sentences from my text book to an <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> flashcard deck. Iâ€™ll make sure that I understand the translation of these sentences before I add them.</p>

<p>Because the Syriac writing system is quite different from what Iâ€™m used to and has a lot of silent letters. Iâ€™m going to include a rough phonetic transcription on the back of each card along with the translation.</p>

<p>Another trick I learned is to bold new vocabulary that you want to learn. This will be more useful after Iâ€™m more comfortable reading and donâ€™t need a full translation on each card. At that point, Iâ€™ll stop adding full translations and just note the meaning of the bolded words.</p>

<h2 id="cloze-grammar-cards">Cloze grammar cards</h2>

<p>For more details see <a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/05/16/anki-cloze-tables.html">this post</a>.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to use cloze deletions to become more familiar with the paradigms.</p>

<p>These seem to work really well for me to become comfortable with how a paradigm works.</p>

<p>This is in tension with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input over grammar</code> principle above, but I find such <em>familarity</em> to be helpful.</p>

<p>Again, not memorizing to memorize, but familiarity.</p>

<h2 id="spaced-repeated-reading">Spaced, repeated reading</h2>

<p>See <a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/06/10/spaced-reading.html">this post</a> for more details.</p>

<p>In short the idea is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> to schedule rereading material that qualifies as comprehensible input.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by using a spaced repetition software.</p>

<p>For me this is Anki.</p>

<p>At the beginning, the cards will simple be the sentences from my textbooks. Once Iâ€™m more comfortable, then the cards will probably be links, book + page numbers, or references to the material that I want to read.</p>
