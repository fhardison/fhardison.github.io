I"<p>Wouldn’t it be great to be able to read Greek? To read the New Testament, Plato, or other Greek writers in their original language? Wouldn’t it be great to be free of translations and experience the artistry of the originals?

<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>

<p>But Greek is usually taught like it’s a code. Something for computers and cryptologists and not for mere mortals. Instructors give us pages of grammar tables and vocab lists and say “Memorize!” and “Translate!”. While this method works for a few dedicated souls, it’s not how languages are <em>really</em> learned. It works against the brain’s natural language acquisition paths. So that those who learn Greek this way, learn it in spite of the methods.</p>

<h1 id="the-solution">The Solution</h1>

<p>The research in language acquisition says that humans learn language by understanding messages in the target language. What?!? We learn by understanding <em>most</em> of what we read or hear. Then moving on to something slightly more challenging and then more challenging. Thus we expand our ability to understand and utilize the language through understanding what we encounter in the language. This is known as Comprehensible Input (CI). To learn a language, we need expose ourselves to input that is at least 95% understandable.</p>

<p>How do we do this with Greek?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://whereareyourkeys.org/">Where Are Your Keys</a> (WAYK) – a method of learning languages that is seeing success in language revitalization efforts.</p>

<p>By using props, gestures, and Sign Language, we can make messages understandable even if we don’t understand the grammar or vocabulary of the utterance.</p>

<p>Think about it. This is how we communicate with young children. We hold up an object and say its name. Then we say something about it. These things create context and we can guess the intended meaning. Thus we have comprehensible input and our brains can acquire the language naturally and without all the mental anguish associated with the aforementioned code and cryptography approach.</p>

<h1 id="the-plan">The Plan</h1>

<p>But the goal is to read, not just play games with props right?</p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<p>After a few sessions of using WAYK, we’ll be able to start understanding simple, but real Greek texts with minimal helps.</p>

<p>WAYK allows us to develop a feel for the language and naturally (and unconsciously) acquire the grammar. We then supplement this base by vocabulary expansion through reading and principled use of memory techniques and software.</p>

<p>You can see a demonstration of the WAYK method applied to New Testament (Koine) Greek <a href="https://youtu.be/-ETMt_qjfz0">here</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Xk-hdIEqXuw">here</a>.</p>
