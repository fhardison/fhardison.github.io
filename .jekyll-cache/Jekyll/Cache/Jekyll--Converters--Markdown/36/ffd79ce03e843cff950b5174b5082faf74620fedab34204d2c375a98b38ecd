I"z<p>Ancient and Koine Greek vowels contract in ways that are simply maddening. Sometimes you are looking at a word and wondering what on earth it means. Then it turns out that you know this word quite well, but couldnâ€™t tell what the root was because half of the letters were missing. They had contracted with various prefixes and suffixes leaving us scratching our heads.</p>
