I"÷<p>For the last few weeks Iâ€™ve been working on Koine Greek readers illustrated with Legos. I suppose they are inspired by <em>Lingua Latina per se illustrata</em>. Iâ€™m making the source text and images available at <a href="https://github.com/fhardison/koine-greek-readers">https://github.com/fhardison/koine-greek-readers</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not the best at accent rules yet so most of the words do not have accents. I hope to improve this as I go.</p>
