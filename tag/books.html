                <p>Below are some resources that I like, have used, or want to use as well as my thoughts on them. Hopefully, I'll update this page as I find more resources.</p>
<h1>Basic Grammars</h1>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Mounce</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">William</span> <span class="n">D</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="mi">2009</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Basics</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">Biblical</span> <span class="n">Greek</span> <span class="n">Grammar</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="n">rd</span> <span class="n">Ed</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Grand</span> <span class="n">Rapids</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Zondervan</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Mounce's book is what my first Greek class used. There may be other books out there that are better, but I'm fond of this one and would recommend it as an introduction.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Betts</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Gavin</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="mi">2004</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Teach</span> <span class="n">Yourself</span> <span class="n">Ancient</span> <span class="n">Greek</span> <span class="n">Complete</span> <span class="n">Course</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="n">nd</span> <span class="n">Ed</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Blacklick</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">McGraw</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Hill</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I've fiddled with this book. It's not too hard, but it <em>dumps</em> new vocabulary on you by the train car load and thus brings a huge memorization load. It does have lots of examples from a variety of sources, some of which are longer form content &ndash; which I like. it might be better to work through something else first through. I can't really say, though, because I had already used Mounce's book before I got this one. Hopefully, I'll work all the way through it one of these days.</p>

</pre></div>


<p>I have not used this book (available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Read-New-Testament-Greek/dp/0805444939">here</a>), but Black is one of the pioneers in bringing the insights of modern linguistics to Koine Greek studies &ndash; at least from my perspective. I would like to look through it one day. And though I have not read it, I would recommend it based on the reputation of its author.</p>
<h1>Greek readers</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://simonidesproject.github.io/SimonidesPage/index.html">Simonides Project</a> has reformatted <a href="https://simonidesproject.github.io/SimonidesPage/book.greek.html">Greek</a> and Latin readers that are out of print and no longer under copyright. They are free and look fantastic.</p>

<p><em>You need read this at some point.</em></p>
<p>This is my favorite Greek book because it explains how Koine Greek communicates. Unlike other grammars, it doesn't focus the nuts and bolts of verbs or the case system, rather this books explores how Greek forms larger unites of thought. As readers of Koine Greek, our ultimate goal is to understand what the author is trying to say, how it is being said, and what he/she is trying to emphasize. This book unlocks these aspect of the language.</p>
<p>I also love it because Runge's book sits at the crossroads of Koine Greek studies and <a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/discourse-analysis-what-speakers-do-conversation">discourse analysis</a>. I think that it is one of many books that we are seeing and will see in the future that take insights from the field of linguistics and applies them to Koine Greek. Runge takes linguistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_analysis">discourse analysis</a> and applies it to Koine Greek in a way that is easy to understand &ndash; even if you aren't a linguist. He uses lots of examples and works through them so you can how the ideas he is talking about work out in practice.</p>
<h1>Online Courses</h1>
<h2>Video</h2>
<ul>
<li>Leonard Muellner and Belisi Gillespie present a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq5ea-jR9u2puDaLoRL-nBkpwrkURbLjT">video series on Ancient Greek</a> and use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Greek-Intensive-Course-2nd-Revised-dp-0823216632/dp/0823216632/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;qid=">Greek: An Intensive Course</a> as their textbook. I have not watched this course in full or used this book, but I wanted to mention it as a resource if you are looking for an online course in Ancient Greek.</li>
</ul>
<h2>University of Texas at Arlington courses</h2>
<p>The University of Texas at Arlington has online courses (or lessons) that introduce many ancient languages including Classical and Koine Greek. I have looked at them before, though I have never worked through them all the way. I am noting them here for reference. Both the Classical and Koine Greek course provide an overview of the language and some lessons based on Greek texts.</p>

<h1>Where Are Your Keys (WAYK)</h1>
<p><a href="https://whereareyourkeys.org/">Where Are Your Keys</a> is one of the main methods that I will be trying out in my Greek course in Fall 2018. Below are links that I have found related to WAYK and Greek.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seumas McDonald has a number of interesting resources.<ul>
<li>His current site <a href="https://thepatrologist.com/">The Patrologist</a> has a lot of interesting thoughts on Greek and Latin.</li>
<li>He also has a few intro videos on Youtube demonstrating how to use WAYK with Koine Greek (see <a href="https://youtu.be/-ETMt_qjfz0">here</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Xk-hdIEqXuw">here</a>).</li>
<li>His old blog has a page about <a href="http://jeltzz.blogspot.com/2012/05/wayk-greek.html">WAYK and Greek</a></li>
<li>Finally he has worked out a curriculum for WAYK and Greek and posted it <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/intensiveaudiolanguages/greek-course">here</a> along with an interesting lexicon of a variety of languages that is available <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/intensiveaudiolanguages/home/out-of-control-lexicon">here</a></li>
<li>He also has a <a href="https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/odianuktosdialogos">podcast</a> in Ancient Greek</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Greek and Latin <a href="https://latinandgreekchats.weebly.com/">online chat via Google Hangouts</a>. I personally have never participated, but it is something that is worth knowing about.  </li>
