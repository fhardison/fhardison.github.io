# The rules of the game

WAYK is a cooperative learning game, where learners and teachers work together to make leanguage learning fun, easy, and succesfful. The foundation of this game is a group of techniques. According to the [WAYK site](http://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-glossary/#technique), 

> Techniques, or TQs for short, are the essence of WAYK. TQs are a collection of tested strategies for maximizing the speed, ease, and efficiency of language transfer. Throwing a TQ elicits a specific action or reaction that streamlines learning. Any player (teacher or student, learner or leader) can throw TQs at any time. Signaling Technique provides a time out to make suggestions or discuss how to further the game or improve the interaction. As a community, we have developed TQs for immersion, documentation, classroom management, community organizing, curriculum development, and more.

I've devided the technqiques into groups based on their function in the game our group is playing. You can download a list of the techniques you will want to use in class [here](/assets/techniques-handout.pdf). Some of the ones listed here are for your information and will be used primarily by the group leader.


# How to play

| Technique | Description | Sign (from WAYK site) |
|:--|:--|:--|
[Full Sentences](https://whereareyourkeys.org/tq-full-sentences/) | Try to speak in full sentences while playing the game even if you can say something with less words. | ![](https://whereareyourkeys.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/full-sentences.gif) |
|[Copy Cat](https://whereareyourkeys.org/7-copy-cat-the-top-20-wayk-techniques/)| "Copy and repeat exactly what the person who calls this TQ is doing. It’s a way for the learner to engage with the texture of the language without having to think about what things mean. “Copy what I say and what I do and you’ll figure it out.”   | ![](https://whereareyourkeys.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/full-sentences.gif) | 
| [Mumble](http://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-glossary/#mumble) | This technique lets you say something that you aren't sure is correct without working about people jumping on you. "A learner signals Mumble to create a correction-free space when they’re uncertain about a piece of language."  | ![](https://whereareyourkeys.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mumble.gif)|
| [Setup](http://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-glossary/#setup) | "WAYK players use Set Ups instead of textbooks, worksheets, and dictionaries to extract language from real situations. A Set Up might take the shape of objects on a table, drawings, pictures, or people acting out a scene...Players can signal Set Up to request a physical scenario that exemplifies the target language. You can also signal Set Up to let other players know if you’re about to construct an example for the language, so they don’t get confused when you run around the room or out the door to gather props....." | ![](https://whereareyourkeys.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/set-up.gif)|


# I need help!

[Technique Angel](https://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-angel/)| Use this technique to get someone in the group to slowly mouth or sound out the words you need.| ![](https://whereareyourkeys.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Talia-Angeling-e1530780554114-225x300.jpg)  |



# How we're going to setup the game

| Technique | Description | Sign | 
|:--|:--|:--|
| [Bridge Language](http://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-glossary/#bridgelanguage) | We will be using sign language to provide a bridge between English and Koine Greek. This helps memory and also helps keep the meaning clear when words change form &ndash; something that Greek words are apt to do. WAYK uses American Sign language, but emplys the grammar of the target language (in our case Greek) as described [here](http://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-glossary/#signlanguage) | ![](https://whereareyourkeys.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bridge-language.gif) | 
| [Obviously](http://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-glossary/#obviously) | Do things so that the meaning is clear and unambigious | ![](https://whereareyourkeys.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/obviously.gif) |
| [Limit](http://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-glossary/#limit) | Keep things as focused and simple as possible so that learners don't get overwhealmed. | ![](https://whereareyourkeys.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/limit.gif) |
| [Bite Sized Pieces](http://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-glossary/#bitesizedpiece) | Try to teach one small, simple, part of the language at a time. "Leaders throw Bite-Sized Piece to find out if players are ready to move on." | ![](https://whereareyourkeys.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bite-sized-piece.gif) | 
[In Threes](http://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-glossary/#inthrees) | Do things three times to give people the repititions they need to understand and learn them. | |
| [Craigslist](http://whereareyourkeys.org/technique-glossary/#craigslist) | "Craigslists are sets of related words that can be practiced together outside of a sentence (e.g., yes/no/maybe or I/you/he/she)...." | ![](https://whereareyourkeys.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/craigs-list.gif) |
