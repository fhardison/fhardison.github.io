<li>Ask and answer Yes/No question,</li>
<li>Ask and tell whose something is,</li>
<li>Ask where something is, and</li>
<li>Tell that something is "in" or "on" something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Grammar introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nominative and Dative case for 1st and 2nd declension nouns and 1st declension adjectives,</li>
<li>Genitive case for 1st and 2nd person pronouns,</li>
<li>Present, 3rd person singular of the 'to be' verb,</li>

<li>Dative case prepositions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you were in class, try to play the WAYK game with a stone, cup, and rocks. You can follow along with the Conversations handout, but try to create some original sentences.</p>
<p>If you were not in class then watch the following videos from Seumas McDonald. Don't worry if you don't understand all the words/grammar, focus on understanding the message:</p>
