Below are some books that I like, have used, or want to use as well as my thoughts on them. hopefully, I'll update this page as I find more resrouces.

# Basic Grammars

    Mounce, William D. 2009. Basics of Biblical Greek Grammar. 3rd Ed. Grand Rapids: Zondervan.

Mounce's book is what my first Greek class used. There may be other books out there that are better, but I'm fond of this one and would recomend it as an introduction.

    Betts, Gavin. 2004. Teach Yourself Ancient Greek Complete Course. 2nd Ed. Blacklick: McGraw-Hill.

I've fiddled with this book. It's not too hard, but it *dumps* new vocabulary on you by the train car load and thus brings a huge memorization load. It does have lots of examples from a variety of sources, some of which are longer form content &ndash; which I like. it might be better to work through something else first through. I can't really say, though, because I had already used Mounce's book before I got this one. Hopefully, I'll work all the way through it one of these days.

    Black, David Alan. 2009. Learn to Read New Testament Greek. 3rd ed. Nashville: Broadman & Holman Publishers.

I have not used this book (available [here](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Read-New-Testament-Greek/dp/0805444939)), but Black is one of the pioneers in bringing the insights of modern linguistics to Koine Greek studies &ndash; at least from my perspective. I would like to look through it one day. And though I have not read it, I would recomend it based on the reputation of its author.



# Refernce Works

    Runge, Steven E. 2010. Discourse Grammar of the Greek New Testament: A Practical Introduction for Teaching and Exegesis. Peabody: Hendrickson.

*You need read this at somepoint.*

This is my favorite Greek book because it explains how Koine Greek communicates. Unlike other grammars, it doesn't forcus the nuts and bolts of verbs or the case system, rather this books explores how Greek forms larger unites of thought. As readers of Koine Greek, our ultimate goal is to understand what the author is trying to say, how it is being said, and what he/she is trying to emphasize. This book unlocks these aspect of the language. 

I also love it because Runge's book sits at the crossroads of Koine Greek studies and [discourse analysis](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/discourse-analysis-what-speakers-do-conversation). I think that it is one of many books that we are seeing and will see in the future that take insightes from the field of linguistics and applies them to Koine Greek. Runge takes lingistic [discourse analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_analysis) and applies it to Koine Greek in a way that is easy to understand &ndash; even if you aren't a linguist &ndash;. He uses lots of examples and works through them so you can how the ideas he is talking about work out in practice.
