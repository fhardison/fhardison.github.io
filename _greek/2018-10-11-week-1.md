This week we began learning Koine Greek with Where Are Your Keys.

Here are the handouts:

* [Conversations week 1](/assets/pdf-lesson-1.pdf)
* [Techniques handout](/assets/pdf-techniques-handout.pdf)

We had four conversations and learned how to:

* Ask and tell what something is,
* Ask and answer Yes/No question,
* Ask and tell whose something is,
* Ask where something is, and
* Tell that something is "in" or "on" something.


Grammar introduced:

* Nominative and Dative case for 1st and 2nd declension nouns and 1st declension adjectives,
* Genitive case for 1st and 2nd person pronouns,
* Present, 3rd person singular of the 'to be' verb,
* Movable-nu, and
* Dative case prepositions.

# Homework

If you were in class, try to play the WAYK game with a stone, cup, and rocks. You can follow along with the Conversations handout, but try to create some original sentences.

If you were not in class then watch the following videos from Seumas McDonald. Don't worry if you don't understand all the words/grammar, focus on understanding the message:
