This week we began learning Koine Greek with Where Are Your Keys.

We had four conversations and learned how to:

* Ask and tell what something is,
* Ask and answer Yes/No question,
* Ask and tell whose something is,
* Ask where something is, and
* Tell that something is "in" or "on" something.


Grammar introduced:

* Nominative and Dative case for 1^st^ and 2^nd^ declention nouns and their adjectives.
* Genitive case for 1^st^ and 2^nd^ person pronouns.
* Present, 3^rd^ person singular of the 'to be' verb.
* Movable-nu
* Dative case prepositions
