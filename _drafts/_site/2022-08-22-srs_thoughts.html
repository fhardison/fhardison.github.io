<p>I have lately been attempting to learn Homeric Greek. I tried @SHE2005 and find it to be useful, but not as easy as Pharr^[@pharr1920].</p>

<p>The thing that makes Pharr so nice to work with is that the vocabulary in each chapter is directly tied to exercises and the extracts from the Iliad. Also, the exercises are quite often simplified versions of the iliad extract, and even if they are not, they include vocabulary or forms that are soon to be found in said extracts. As Crane points out, Pharr’s book is centered around getting learners to the point that they can read book 1 of the Iliad.^[@crane2022].</p>

<p>Thus, the vocabulary lists, exercises, and and Iliad extracts build upon one another and conspire to provide the learner with a fair amount of repetition while also actually reading an authentic Greek text that students would likely be interested in reading.</p>

<h1 id="srs-flashcards">SRS flashcards</h1>

<p>I have also been pondering the place of SRS flashcards^[Spaced Repetition Software based flashcards] in this process. One of the shortfalls of flashcards is that they don’t provide repeated exposure to words in different contexts. If they are not made properly, the the student can simply learn the card rather than the linguistic chunk intended.</p>

<p>However, combining an SRS tool, such as Anki^[<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">https://apps.ankiweb.net/</a>], with the carefully crafted exercises from a textbook like Pharr could help avoid these pitfalls.</p>

<p>At this point, I have two anki decks that I update each chapter as I work my way trough Pharr. One is a deck of vocabulary and the second deck contains the Greek exercises and Iliad extracts. Anki allows HTML in flashcards so it is simple to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt; br/&gt;</code> to add the poety from the Iliad and maintain the line breaks. I add the relevant sections from Pharr into their corresponding decks and then review them.</p>

<p>Since Anki syncs from desktop to phone, I add new content to the decks on my laptop and sync it to my phone for review.</p>

<h1 id="thoughts-on-nt-greek">Thoughts on NT Greek</h1>

<p>I think the above method is proving helpful because of the quality of Pharr’s textbook. I have real doubts about using it with other books. For example, my first exposure to New Testament Greek was through Mounce’s grammar!sidenote(bibliographical info).</p>

<p>If memory serves, Mounce supplies exercises from the NT as soon as possible based on the points and vocabulary covered in the Grammar. This is similar to Pharr. The difference, however, is that Mounce is not building toward anything. Pharr is building to reading Iliad book 1 so his exercises are built around the next section of the Iliad to be read. This means that there is story and context for the vocabulary and exercises. This was not the case with Mounce.</p>

<p>I suspect that there are other GNT textbooks available that are orientented toward reading a particular book of the GNT (or perhaps LXX) and I think this is a good thing. The use of “textbook Greek” and simplified exercises to get students reading a large and sequentual chunk of a GNT book would be much more helpful than a collection of whatever verses happen to exhibit the point of grammar and vocabulary taught in the chapter.</p>

<p>Some GNT books contain sections that are quite difficult or may contain a lot of grammar that hasn’t be covered yet. This really isn’t a problem as these difficulties could either be overcome by footnotes containing the needed information to understand them, or they could simply be summarized and/or simplified. This would allow the student to keep tracking the plot/argument of the GNT book without being overly bogged down by sections that are two difficult.</p>

<p>Crane rightly points out however that Pharr teaches words that may be low frequence in the rest of the Homeric corpus because they are needed for reading Iliad, book 1. But he also points out that with digital tools, we can easily provide glosses and not require students to learn these words. The same thing is true for the GNT. While a word may be important for understanding the GNT book a course is developed around, it can simply be footnoted if it is not as relevant to the GNT as a whole.</p>
