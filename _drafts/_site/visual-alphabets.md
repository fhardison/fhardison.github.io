Sometimes words are easy to learn and sometimes they aren't. 

Anki is a great tool for learning vocabulary because it helps identify which words are easy and which need extra effort to master. If  a word has been shown a few times and I can't remember it, then it's time to look for an association between the meaning and the sound of the word. I usually prefer associations based on sound or the spelling of a word. 

**Sometimes the sound of the word suggests an association.** 

For example the Hebrew word _nasa'_ means to pull something out. _nasa'_ sounds like NASA so I imagine a navy crew trying to pull an oversized astronought out of a small Mercury capsule. And presto, I have an association and story to help remember the meaning of the word.

**Sometimes the sounds don't suggest any association.** 

What can I do in cases like this? 

This is where I like the use of a Bestiary. A bestiary was a book popular in Medieval Europe that was usually organized alphabetically with an animal associated with each letter. They were used to teach virtues or other religious lessons. For memory purposes bestiaries are wonderful visual alphabets. 

**Visual alphabets associate a character with each letter to help build associations.**  

Being an English speaker I naturally have one for all 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, but what about languages -- like Hebrew -- with sounds that don't correspond to English well? There are a couple of options:  

1. Create a few extra characters to cover the new sounds, or
2. Create a new visual alphabet with characters based on words for animals or people etc in the target language. 

Options 1 is easier than option 2 by far. But one advantage of option 2 is that it causes us to learn more words in the target language. 

**On a whole, I prefer option 1 because I want my memory to work easily and with minimal effort.** 

The word _natah_ which means 'stretch out, bend, extend' was giving me trouble. In my visual alphabet, N is a narwhale, T is a tapir, and H is a hawk. I imaged a narwhale reaching out it's horn to save a Tapir that was being carried off by a hawk. Are there better ways to memorize difficult words? Probably. But I like having this tool for cases where I can't find a natural association for the sounds of the word. 

**Visual alphabets provide a means to create associations and mnemonics where the spelling or sounds of a word don't suggest an association.**
