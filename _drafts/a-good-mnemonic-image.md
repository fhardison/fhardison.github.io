What if I told you that a simple image can be all you need to create a mnemonic with real sticking power?

You've probably heard that mental images need to be bright, colorful, crazy, perhaps obscene, and fully of action. While I agree that this can work for some people, I don't believe that it is necessary &ndash; or even the most effective &ndash; for everyone.

I am a mnemonist that complicated, action filled images don't work well for. If you feel overwhealmed by having to invent action filled stories for each thing you want to memorize, let me propose an alternaitve for your consideration. 

# What I learned in Swedish

[Mattias Ribbing](http://www.grandmasterofmemory.com/) is a Swedish speaker, teacher, and mnemonist. I listened to everything of his I could find and finally decided to learn to read Swedish so I could read his books (I was learning Dutch at the time, was too cheap to pay $50 for the English Video coures, and thought adding another language would be fun). This post is primarily based on his book [*The Way to a Master Memory*](https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/vagen-till-mastarminne-forandra-ditt-liv-med-kraftfull-minnestraning-9789172322646) 

The core of many memory techniques is converting information into an image. Ribbing has his on take on how to do this based on the [Giordano Memory System](http://www.sevensigma.info/articles/4memory.html). 

Ribbing begins with the principle that we can't memorize things in isolation, but they they need to be connected. So visualizing one image by itself is not helpful. We need to create couplings of images that touch, sit on, or even pierce each other in some way. If you like me and you're memorizing texts or foreign language vocabulary, then you connecting images makes things easier anyway.

Ribbing says "To be able to quickly create good couplings, we need to to visualize *memory-friendly images*"  and sets forth the following criteria for these memory-friendly images:

> This means images of physical objects that we can see in front of us in the room, big, in color, three-dimensional and detailed. The images must also have contours that clearly delimit them from the environment (Ribbing 2011, *translation mine*).

He also adds that we should use the first images that comes to mind that has these criteria and that the image should be still.

If this sounds like a lot, that's ok. It becomes nearly automatic with practice. 

I have rephrased this his criteria so that they can be remembered with the phrase "TeDDy CaFe." Imagine a Winnie the Pooh having a coffee in Starbucks.

* It's ***T**hree dimensional*, not flat
* It's ***D**istinct* and has clear contours (sharp angles are a bonus too)
* It's ***D**etailed*
* it's *in **C**olor*
* It's the ***F**irst image I think up* that has the above characteristics


The image below is the size of an index card and can be printed and kept with you as a reminder of these principles (a PDF is available [here](/assets/images/TeDDy_CaFe.pdf))

Two final points from Ribbing and my own experience:

**Try to imagine the image in front of you taking up space.** This takes some practice but I think it pays off. I often look to where various parts of it would be if it were really in front of me. Ribbing has said in some of his [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFtPOUx7Hk) that this helps. I agree. 

**When you visualize an image, take a few seconds to really see it. Notice what details that your mind provides.** Even if you just think to imagine a book, your brain is probably thinking of a specific book. So take a minute and see what book you are seeing in your mind? Chronicles of Narnia? Lord of the Rings? Oxford English Dictionary? For another example, I wanted to use a knight to remember England (I was memorizing World Cup wins at the time). As I paid attention to the details, I realized that I was imagining a crusader knight with the red cross and white tunic over his armor. These details make the image "sticky" mentally.

# Encoding techniques

Ribbing describes three kinds of encoding strategies that we can use to convert information to images. 

1. Consonance encoding 
2. Symbolic encoding
3. Experiencial encoding

## Consonance encoding

With **consonance encoding** we use a similar sounding word to encode the information we want to memorize. Ribbing notes that this is especially useful for learning foreign language vocab. 

For example, learn the Spanish word *casa* 'house', we might use the English word *cash* to help remember the pronunciation. So our mental image would be a house made out of cash.  

## Symbolic encoding

With this kind of encoding a symbol use used to encode the new information. For example, a heart is often used as a symbol for "love". A flag could be used in place of the country it represents. The idea is to use something closely associated with thing to be remember as a symbol for it. 

## Experiential encoding

With experiential encoding we encode information using a personal connection. For example, I memorized the word *Benjaminite* by using an baby blue electric guitar because a good friend of mine whose middle name is Benjamin and he plays a baby blue Fender.

To use this technique find something from your experience that helps you remember the new information. 

# Summary

Many memory technique teachers recommend using bright, action-filled stories to convert information to something that can stick in long-term memory. However, that's not the case for all memory teachers. I personally find creating such images difficult and all the action makes them hard to visualize.  

I use still, "TeDDy CaFe" images as we have discussed. I find them less stressful to work with and more effective for me. When looking for images, we can encode information using a rhyming technique, symbolic association technique, or a experiential encoding technique.
