                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Language. What is it? We know we use to communicate and that it has words/signs, grammar, sounds, etc. But what is it?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://amindforlanguage.com/images/web-jingyi-wang-photo.jpg"></p>
<p>It is a means of communication and thus implies a message and a means. In linguistics, this pairing of message and means is often called a construction or sign (to use the venerable term coined by De Saussure). Communication is also social; it implies a speaker/writer and a listener/reader.</p>
<p>So here's the point of this post. <strong>Language is a network of associations</strong>: <em>in the brain and between people.</em></p>
<p>I have never read it put exactly this way in linguistics per se. But I think it's is a good summary of a 2009 paper by the "Five Graces Group" [1] that called language a "Complex Adaptive System" (CAS). This  means that language exists as a group of interacting agents (people/neurons) interacting and it changes and adapts as a result of this interaction. It is complex because there are a lot of agents and it adapts in ways we may not expect. FYI, they Wikipedia page [2] on CASs list the brain as an example of a CAS.</p>
<h1>A social network</h1>
<p><img alt="" src="https://amindforlanguage.com/images/people-network.jpeg"></p>
<p>When people interact they form a network or system. As they do this, they change and grow. The ways they communicate change and grow too.</p>
<p>Think about the impact of social media and text messages have had on language. We interact in type a lot more now. This has spawned new abbreviations and acronyms. Some of which have found their way into spoken language [3].</p>
<p>But our speech individual speech changes as we interact with others. We start to talk like our friends or co-workers. You may start saying new words or changing the way you pronounce them because of a new acquaintance. Language exists as a network of people interacting who affect each other and each other's language.</p>
<h1>A neural network</h1>
<p><img alt="" src="https://amindforlanguage.com/images/brain.jpg"></p>
<p>The brain is also a CAS that stores and controls our ability to use language. The Graces' paper adopts the view of grammar "in which the cognitive organization of language is based directly on experience with language" (p.5). The way our brain stores and organizes language is based on our experience, not what we have read in grammar textbook.</p>
<p>The Graces further state that our brains store language by grouping chunks of language into clusters of related chunks based on their form, meaning, and "the context in which they have been experienced..." (p.7). Instead of having a bunch of rules in our heads, we have a catalogue of chunks.</p>
<p>This explains why we perceive links between sentences like "I have been doing something" and "I had been doing something". They have almost identical form and only slightly different meaning (their tense/aspect). But we may not frequently see the link between "merry" and "happy". Even though they have similar meanings, they are not used in the same context ("Happy birthday", and "Merry Christmas" (if you're American), but not "Merry Birthday").</p>
<h2>What is a chunk</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="https://amindforlanguage.com/images/chunk.jpg"></p>
<p>So what are these chunks? According to the Graces's paper, these chunks are direct form-meaning pairs known as "constructions". They can be things like idioms, the shape of passive sentence, or something small like a the English past tense suffix <em>-ed</em> (p. 5). An individual word is a construction. So is a phrase or idiom. So are things that we would normally think of as "grammar" like the pattern of an active or passive sentence.</p>
<p><em>Essentially constructions can be any meaningful chunk of language.</em> The brain perceives them and then groups them with other similar constructions based on form, meaning, and context. The more chunks that we experience, the more the brain has to work with. It categories them and our grammar, even of our own languages, changes based on our experience using the language and interacting with people.</p>
<p>The Graces' paper says that when we learn a new language our brains store new constructions and refines its groupings and understanding of these constructions over time. Our understanding of a construction in our new language is "sensitive" to how often we are exposed to it, how recently we were exposed to it, and context (presumably the one in which we encounter it).</p>
<h1>Application</h1>
<p><img alt="" src="https://amindforlanguage.com/images/takeaway.jpg"></p>
<p>So what does this mean for us as language learners? Here are a few thoughts:</p>
<h2>Learn in chunks and add them to your network</h2>
<p>The Grace's paper did not said that we have to understand every detail of a construction or chunk to begin using it. Learning new chunks is an iterative process as our brains group and regroup the chunks it encounters. If you don't understand the detail of a chunk, just learn it as a unit and start using it. IT becomes part of your mental network and your brain will sort out the details as you go along.</p>
<p>By learning the chunk as a unit first, you can keep making progress in the language.</p>
<p>That said, the Graces' paper also notes that explicit instruction can help if the thing being taught helps us understand what the chunk means. So if we're having trouble with some new chunk, explicit study of grammar <em>may</em> help if it helps us understand the meaning. The meaning is the important part, nor the form.</p>
<h2>We need people too</h2>
<p>Language is a network that exists between you and other speakers/users of the language. Interacting with and hearing others speak is how we learned our first language. Don't forget to interact with others. Relationships are what make life rich and these interactions can really help your language skills develop quickly. Speaking with others trains your speaking and listening skills all at the same time. And it's fun!</p>
<h2>We need input and repeated exposure to stuff we understand</h2>
<p>Our brains form their network of chunks based on experience. So we need a lot of exposure to our new language so that our brains can grow their network. The more chunks we are exposed to the more our brain has to work with. Recall that a construction or chunk is a form-meaning pair. If we don't understand, then we only the the form, but not the meaning. Thus the chunk is defective and probably won't help us. It may cause stress and confusion when we come to speak.</p>
<p>Comprehensible input is generally defined as input that is 92-95% comprehensible. When we don't understand something, it creates stress and can quickly become noise that our brain filters out. This means we need to (try to) pick things that are comprehensible. If we don't have comprehensible material available, then we need to try to make it that way. More on that later.</p>
<h2>Chunks can be anything</h2>
<p>Chunks exist on many levels of a language: sentence structure, verb forms, idioms, phrases, etc. So if we find something that we think will be useful, we should play with it, add it to your flashcards, and practice it. There is no reason to say that we <em>have to</em> learn single words or that everything <em>has</em> to be in a sentence or phrase.</p>
<h2>We should practice and play with chunks repeatedly</h2>
<p>Repetition is key to telling our brains that something is important. So say the memory experts. By practicing and playing with a chunk, we giving our brain new chances to categorize it and making it easier to recall when we need it.</p>
<p>By <em>playing</em>, I mean swapping bits of the chunk for other words or chunks. Making "He was seen by me" into "She was seen by me" and then "She was hit by the car" etc. This <em>playing</em> reinforces connections between the construction and other constructions in our brains.</p>
<p>We also need to see the chunk again after a period of time so add it to your SRS app or other review system.</p>
<h2>We should capitalize on associations.</h2>
<p>The Graces' paper said that our brain categorizes things based on form, meaning, and context. We can focus on finding associations for three things when we want to learn a new chunk by asking the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the form of the chunk remind us of?</li>
<li>Is the order of this new chunk like the order of one we already know?</li>
<li>It is different, if so how?</li>
<li>What does the meaning remind us of?</li>
<li>When you think about this idea/concept, what is the first thing that pops into your mind?</li>
<li>Can you associate it with a movie/TV show? or something that is scary, shocking, funny, or unusual?</li>
<li>How about the context in which we learned it or heard it most recently? Can we associate it with that context somehow? If we read the word in a Sherlock Holmes book can we imagine it wearing a hat and trench coat and smoking a pipe or saying "Elementary my dear Watson"?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Positive language transfer</h2>
<p>Now for a departure from the Graces' paper. We learn by association, and memories are stronger the more associations they have. Because our native language is in our brain, we may as well connect new chunk to it as well.</p>
<p>For example, if we are learning Dutch and know that the Dutch way to say "I like it" is "Ik vind het leuk" (literally "I find it nice"), then why not make this association too. Once we become comfortable using the Dutch phrase, then the association with our native language can fall away. But in the mean time, it provides another link to the Dutch phrase and another way to remember it.</p>
<h2>It's all a network, working on one part helps keeps the whole thing healthy</h2>
<p>Research shows us that we don't learn one piece of language perfectly and then move onto the next part. We learn lots of parts at the same time. No point in beating yourself up if you make a mistake. Move on to other topics and keep trying. Given time and exposure, you'll get better at the thing that is driving you up a wall right now.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Research based on cognitive science and what we know about the brain tells us that language works like a network that adapts and grows as it is used. Not only is it a network between speakers of the language, but it's also stored as a network in our own brains. We can leverage this to learn new languages more efficient and enjoyable ways.</p>
