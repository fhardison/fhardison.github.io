  {"id":"_most_2016","abstract":"The list below of most common words in English cannot be definitive. It is based on an analysis of the Oxford English Corpus of over a billion words, and represents one study done by Oxford Online, associated with the Oxford English Dictionary. This source includes writings of all sorts from \"literary novels and specialist journals to everyday newspapers and magazines and from Hansard to the language of chatrooms, emails, and weblogs\", unlike some sources which use texts from only specific sources. The Reading Teacher's Book of Lists claims that the first 25 words make up about one-third of all printed material in English, and that the first 100 make up about one-half of all written material. Note that \"word\" may mean either a word form (essentially, a distinct spelling), or a lexeme (essentially, a \"base\" word or dictionary-entry). For instance the lexeme \"be\", listed below, includes occurrences of \"are\", \"is\", \"were\", \"was\", etc. Note also that these top 100 lemmas listed below account for 50% of all the words in the Oxford English Corpus.

Building on the momentum currently enjoyed by cognitive-functional approaches to language within the field of Classics, its contributors adopt, in particular, a ?constructional? approach that treats morphosyntactic constructions as meaningful in and of themselves. Thus, they are able to address the role of human cognitive embodiment in determining the meanings of linguistic phenomena as diverse as verbal affixes, discourse particles, prepositional phrases, lexical items, and tense semantics in both Greek and Latin","author":[{"family":"Allan","given":"Rutger J."}],"citation-key":"allan2019","container-title":"Toward a cognitive classical linguistics: the embodied basis of constructions in Greek and Latin","editor":[{"family":"Mocciaro","given":"Egle"},{"family":"Short","given":"William Michael"}],"event-place":"Berlin Boston","ISBN":"978-3-11-061633-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"De Gruyter","publisher-place":"Berlin Boston","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Aspect and construal: A cognative lingusitic approach to iterativity, habituality and genericity in Greek","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"alter2011","abstract":"From celebrated translator of the Hebrew Bible Robert Alter, the classic study of the Bible as literature, a winner of the National Jewish Book Award.Renowned critic and translator Robert Alter's The Art of Biblical Narrative has radically expanded our view of the Bible by recasting it as a work of literary art deserving studied criticism. In this seminal work, Alter describes how the Hebrew Bible's many authors used innovative literary styles and devices such as parallelism, contrastive dialogue, and narrative tempo to tell one of the most revolutionary stories of all time: the revelation of a single God. In so doing, Alter shows, these writers reshaped not only history, but also the art of storytelling itself.","author":[{"family":"Alter","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"alter2011","edition":"1st edition","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",4]]},"language":"english","publisher":"Basic Books","title":"The Art of Biblical Narrative","type":"book"},

The Bible's style, Alter writes, “is not some sort of aesthetic embellishment of the `message' of Scripture but the vital medium through which the biblical vision of God, human nature, history, politics, society, and moral value is conveyed.” And, as the translators of the King James Version knew, the authority of the Bible is inseparable from its literary authority.For these reasons, the Bible can be brought to life in English only by re-creating its literary virtuosity, and Alter discusses the principal aspects of style in the Hebrew Bible that any translator should try to reproduce: word choice, syntax, word play and sound play, rhythm, and dialogue. In the process, he provides an illuminating and accessible introduction to biblical style that also offers insights about the art of translation far beyond the Bible.","author":[{"family":"Alter","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"alterArtBibleTranslation2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3]]},"language":"english","publisher":"Princeton University Press","title":"The Art of Bible Translation","type":"book"},

  {"id":"baskan2012","abstract":"Translation is an activity of mediating meaning from a source language into a target language. The ability to choose the correct translation technique is an indispensable skill to translators; therefore it is essential for translation students to be aware of why a particular technique is used. Past literatures in translation studies have shown that although much has been written about the translation process and product, there is very little research done on class dynamics in a translation classroom (Gonzales Davis 2004). This research focuses on the teaching of translation techniques in a translation classroom from the cooperative learning perspective. Preliminary observations discovered that students tend to use the wrong translation techniques when translating from English into Malay. As an intervention, a methodology that is called `Cooperative Work Procedure' (Gerding-Salas, 2000) is adopted in the teaching of translation in a basic translation course offered by the School of Language Studies and Linguistics, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. The `Cooperative Work Procedure' promotes positive team work from students and it consists of workshop activities that help translation students to acquire appropriate translation techniques when translating a variety type of texts.","author":[{"family":"Baskan","given":"Prof.Dr.Gülsün A."},{"family":"Ozdamli","given":"Assist.Prof.Dr.Fezile"},{"family":"Özcan","given":"Sezer Kanbul; Deniz"},{"family":"Zainudin","given":"Intan Safinaz"},{"family":"Awal","given":"Norsimah Mat"}],"citation-key":"baskan2012","container-title":"Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.202","ISSN":"1877-0428","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1]]},"page":"800–804","title":"Teaching Translation Techniques in a University Setting: Problems and Solutions","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},

A great way to build this conceptual knowledge is by reading advanced texts.

Integrating structured skimming, also called pseudo-skimming, into our book reading process can help us understand advanced texts quicker and retain the knowledge longer.

  {"id":"carroll2018","abstract":"New York Times bestseller! A powerful goal-setting and time-management system for anyone trying to organize their lives by the founder of the enormously popular Bullet Journal® planner. For years Ryder Carroll tried countless organizing systems, online and off, but none of them fit the way his mind worked. Out of sheer necessity, he developed a method called the Bullet Journal that helped him become consistently focused and effective. When he started sharing his system with friends who faced similar challenges, it went viral. Just a few years later, to his astonishment, Bullet Journaling is a global movement. The Bullet Journal Method is about much more than organizing your notes and to-do lists. It's about what Carroll calls \"intentional living\": weeding out distractions and focusing your time and energy in pursuit of what's truly meaningful, in both your work and your personal life. It's about spending more time with what you care about, by working on fewer things. His new book shows you how to...  *  Track the past: Using nothing more than a pen and paper, create a clear and comprehensive record of your thoughts.  *  Order the present: Find daily calm by tackling your to-do list in a more mindful, systematic, and productive way.  *  Design the future: Transform your vague curiosities into meaningful goals, and then break those goals into manageable action steps that lead to big change. Carroll wrote this book for frustrated list-makers, overwhelmed multitaskers, and creatives who need some structure. Whether you've used a Bullet Journal for years or have never seen one before, The Bullet Journal Method will help you go from passenger to pilot of your own life.","author":[{"family":"Carroll","given":"Ryder"}],"citation-key":"carroll2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10]]},"language":"english","publisher":"Portfolio","title":"The Bullet Journal Method: Track the Past, Order the Present, Design the Future","title-short":"The Bullet Journal Method","type":"book"},

In fact, non-Christians actually enjoyed storying and kept coming back for more. Storying provides solid biblical foundations so listeners can understand, apply and respond to the gospel, and then go on to fruitful maturity in God's service.This book includes practical guidance on how to shape a good story, how to do evangelism through storying and how to lead Bible discussions. With particular insights for trainers and those working in crosscultural contexts, this guide provides you with concrete steps for sharing the Story that everyone needs to hear.","author":[{"family":"Dillon","given":"Christine"}],"citation-key":"dillon2012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6]]},"language":"english","publisher":"IVP Books","title":"Telling the Gospel Through Story: Evangelism That Keeps Hearers Wanting More","title-short":"Telling the Gospel Through Story","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Durvasula2009","abstract":"The central aim of this dissertation is to further our understanding of the phonological feature underlying nasality, and thereby improve our understanding of phonological representations and the phonology-phonetics interface, in general. Specifically, I show that given appropriate abstraction and appropriate phonology-phonetics mapping principles, we can most insightfully account for both categorical featural behaviour and variable feature manifestations of nasal segments. The bulk of the dissertation is devoted to a careful study of segments that have been lumped together under the cover term \"prenasalised stops\" (or partially-nasal stops (PNS), in this dissertation). I show that, contrary to the standard view in the phonological literature, there are at least two distinct types of PNS: (1) Nasal-based partially-nasal stops (N-PNS), and (2) Voice-based partially-nasal stops (V-PNS). N-PNS are featurally identical to simple nasal stops that surface as PNS, and are found in languages with no separate nasal series; V-PNS are segments featurally identical to fully-voiced stops that surface as PNS. I argue that their behaviours are best accounted for by re-conceptualising the phonological feature [nasal], as the dimension Soft Palate (SP), which is sensitive to a set of (universal) phonology-phonetics mapping principles. Crucially, the gestural/phonetic manifestation of the discrete representation 'SP' is shown to be sensitive to the nature of laryngeal contrast in the specific syllable position.","author":[{"family":"Durvasula","given":"Karthik"}],"citation-key":"Durvasula2009","event-place":"Newark","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"publisher":"University of Delaware","publisher-place":"Newark","title":"Understanding nasality","type":"thesis"},

As a challenge for this analysis of semelfactives, semantic construction of semelfactives with frequency adverbials will be presented and analysed in terms of a coercion operator.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Egg","given":"Markus"}],"citation-key":"egg2018","container-title":"Oslo Studies in Language","container-title-short":"OSLa","DOI":"10.5617/osla.6676","ISSN":"1890-9639","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,24]]},"source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Semelfactives","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uio.no/osla/article/view/6676","volume":"10"},

Then, a sequential work procedure carried out with undergraduate translation students is described. This methodology, consisting of a step-by-step, either sequential or successive procedure for workshops, which has proven quite successful in translator training at an undergraduate level. The educator is understood as a facilitator of the translation task: The lion's share of the transfer process is accomplished by the students both collectively and individually. The methodology proposed and the corresponding evaluation process are discussed, and the human profiles and the work facilities are defined.

  {"id":"geurts2020","abstract":"In the early 1980s, Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) wasintroduced by Hans Kamp as a theoretical framework for dealing withissues in the semantics and pragmatics of anaphora and tense (Kamp1981); a very similar theory was developed independently by Irene Heim(1982). The distinctive features of DRT, to be discussed below, arethat it is a mentalist and representationalist theory ofinterpretation, and that it is a theory of the interpretation not onlyof individual sentences but of discourse, as well. In these respectsDRT made a clear break with classical formal semantics, which duringthe 1970s had emanated from Montague’s pioneering work (Thomason1974), but in other respects it continued the tradition, e.g., in itsuse of model-theoretical tools. In the meantime, DRT has come to serveas a framework for explaining a wide range of phenomena, but we willconfine our attention to fewer than a handful: anaphora, tense,presupposition, and propositional attitudes.

Building on the momentum currently enjoyed by cognitive-functional approaches to language within the field of Classics, its contributors adopt, in particular, a ?constructional? approach that treats morphosyntactic constructions as meaningful in and of themselves.

The objective of this study is to describe active-passive voice of Wolionese that has not been widely studied. This study applied descriptive qualitative approachusing basic method, direct constituent division and advanced method form changing. The data were obtained by using cooperative method.

In the active voice, the markers found are ku-, ta-, u-, and a- that always be attached in the beginning of the verbs. They sometimes are also followed by -aka, -mo attached in the end of the verb. Meanwhile, in the passive voice there are also several markers found, they are -a, to- and i- that are attached in the end of the verb (-a) and in the beginning of the verb (to- and i-).","author":[{"family":"Mugrib","given":"Nuz"},{"family":"Wahyunianto","given":"Dian"},{"family":"Sumarlam","given":"Sumarlam"}],"citation-key":"mugrib2018","container-title":"LEKSEMA: Jurnal Bahasa dan Sastra","ISSN":"2527-807X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"93–103","title":"PEMARKAH DIATESIS DALAM BAHASA WOLIO","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world.In this timely and enlightening book, the bestselling author of Deep Work introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives.Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience \"fear of missing out\" because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction.Now, Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement, and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips, like turning off notifications, or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath, don't go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives, and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family, friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use, for what purposes, and under what conditions.Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples, from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers, Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media, rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world, and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life, starting with a thirty-day \"digital declutter\" process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control.Technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you. This book shows the way.","author":[{"family":"Newport","given":"Cal"}],"citation-key":"newport2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2]]},"language":"english","publisher":"Portfolio","title":"Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World","title-short":"Digital Minimalism","type":"book"},

  {"id":"riedl2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            In the recent past, many organizations and people have substituted face-to-face meetings with videoconferences. Among others, tools like Zoom, Teams, and Webex have become the “new normal” of human social interaction in many domains (e.g., business, education). However, this radical adoption and extensive use of videoconferencing tools also has a dark side, referred to as videoconference fatigue (VCF). To date only self-report evidence has shown that VCF is a serious issue. However, based on self-reports alone it is hardly possible to provide a comprehensive understanding of a cognitive phenomenon like VCF. Against this background, we examined VCF also from a neurophysiological perspective. Specifically, we collected and analyzed electroencephalography (continuous and event-related) and electrocardiography (heart rate and heart rate variability) data to investigate whether VCF can also be proven on a neurophysiological level. We conducted a laboratory experiment based on a within-subjects design (N = 35). The study context was a university lecture, which was given in a face-to-face and videoconferencing format. In essence, the neurophysiological data—together with questionnaire data that we also collected—show that 50 min videoconferencing, if compared to a face-to-face condition, results in changes in the human nervous system which, based on existing literature, can undoubtedly be interpreted as fatigue. Thus, individuals and organizations must not ignore the fatigue potential of videoconferencing. A major implication of our study is that videoconferencing should be considered as a possible complement to face-to-face interaction, but not as a substitute.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Riedl","given":"René"},{"family":"Kostoglou","given":"Kyriaki"},{"family":"Wriessnegger","given":"Selina C."},{"family":"Müller-Putz","given":"Gernot R."}],"citation-key":"riedl2023","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-023-45374-y","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,26]]},"language":"en","page":"18371","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Videoconference fatigue from a neurophysiological perspective: experimental evidence based on electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG)","title-short":"Videoconference fatigue from a neurophysiological perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-45374-y","volume":"13"},

In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus did this exact experiment - and his results are widely accepted as a general theory for how we learn and retain information. Graphing his results, he developed a formula for how long items remain in our memory. Some people may remember better than others, but the general trend for how long we retain information is the same. The resulting graph is called Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve. The bads news is, it's steeper than you may think.

  {"id":"smith2016","abstract":"Christianity Today Book Award WinnerMartin Institute and Dallas Willard Center Book AwardYou are what you love. But you might not love what you think.In this book, award-winning author James K. A. Smith shows that who and what we worship fundamentally shape our hearts. And while we desire to shape culture, we are not often aware of how culture shapes us. We might not realize the ways our hearts are being taught to love rival gods instead of the One for whom we were made. Smith helps readers recognize the formative power of culture and the transformative possibilities of Christian practices. He explains that worship is the \"imagination station\" that incubates our loves and longings so that our cultural endeavors are indexed toward God and his kingdom. This is why the church and worshiping in a local community of believers should be the hub and heart of Christian formation and discipleship. Following the publication of his influential work Desiring the Kingdom, Smith received numerous requests from pastors and leaders for a more accessible version of that book's content. No mere abridgment, this new book draws on years of Smith's popular presentations on the ideas in Desiring the Kingdom to offer a fresh, bottom-up rearticulation. The author creatively uses film, literature, and music illustrations to engage readers and includes new material on marriage, family, youth ministry, and faith and work. He also suggests individual and communal practices for shaping the Christian life.","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"James K.

Klyne Snodgrass explores in vivid detail the historical context in which these stories were told, the part they played in Jesus' overall message, and the ways in which they have been interpreted in the church and the academy. Snodgrass begins by surveying the primary issues in parables interpretation and providing an overview of other parables—often neglected in the discussion—from the Old Testament, Jewish writings, and the Greco-Roman world. He then groups the more important parables of Jesus thematically and offers a comprehensive treatment of each, exploring both background and significance for today. This tenth anniversary edition includes a substantial new chapter that surveys developments in the interpretation of parables since the book's original 2008 publication.","author":[{"family":"Snodgrass","given":"Klyne R."}],"citation-key":"snodgrass2018","edition":"2 edition","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2]]},"language":"english","publisher":"Eerdmans","title":"Stories with Intent: A Comprehensive Guide to the Parables of Jesus","title-short":"Stories with Intent","type":"book"},

  {"id":"thomas2020a","abstract":"About a year ago I started the first version of my slip-box, and it had several flaws due to my incomplete understanding of the Zettelkasten Method. Disappointed with the results of my note box, I started to read everything about the topic with one goal in my mind - to improve my understanding, fix my mistakes and learn how to make the most out of my slip-box. This video is a result of my aims to understand the original Zettelkasten, to understand how Luhmann used this method, why he followed certain principles and rules, and what do I have to change in my workflow to better my slip-box. 0:00 Introduction 1:09 Shifting mindset: from note-taking to communicating 2:03 Open organization: disorder with consistent internal structure 3:22 Multi-storage principle: card can be stored in multiple positions 3:53 Folgezettel deception: all references are created equal 4:58 Smarter Folgezettels: keeping track of all contexts 5:52 References: the core of Zettelkasten 6:43 Re-defining “selective”: contextually congruent notes 8:34 Quality over quantity: build a map, not a maze 9:32 Innovation tool: ask the slip-box Read the article: Understanding Zettelkasten: What does it mean to communicate with the slip-box https://medium.com/@ethomasv/understa... Read the article: The Folgezettel Conundrum - Deep dive into one of the most debatable concepts of Zettelkasten https://medium.com/@ethomasv/the-folg... My favorite resources: - Niklas Luhmann \"Kommunikation mit Zettelkasten - Ein Erfahrungsbericht\" - Johannes F. K.

Schmidt - Sönke Ahrens \"How to take smart notes\" - Markus Krajewski \"Kommunikation mit Papiermaschinen\" - https://zettelkasten.de I hope this video helped you, that you learned something new and that you will be more confident to use Zettelkasten as personal knowledge management system in the future.
