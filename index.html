                <p>Here's my first shot a making a video about the pronunciation I use for Koine Greek. I"m sure I butcher accents and stumble over plenty of words. But here it is anyway. It uses some vocab that I found reading Dionysis Thrax's <a href="https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A4%CE%AD%CF%87%CE%BD%CE%B7_%CE%93%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE">Τέχνη Γραμματική</a> (Art of Grammar??).</p>

                <p>Syriac is a Semitic language in the same family as Aramaic. It also has one of the earliest transitions the New Testament and is a Christian literary language as well.</p>
<p>It's related to the Aramaic that Jesus and the Apostles would have grown up speaking...</p>
<p>... and it's not widely known ...</p>
<p>... and doesn't have near the resources available as do Greek, Hebrew, or Latin.</p>
<p>My hope is that this series of posts will help throw some light on how to learn it by describing my experience as I'm doing just that.</p>
<p>Consider this an experiment and a test to see if some of the techniques that I have found effective with Koine Greek work for another ancient language.</p>
<h1>Principles</h1>
<p>These are some of the principles that guide how I'm going to go about it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Input over grammar</li>
<li><a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/05/16/anki-cloze-tables.html">Cloze grammar cards</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/06/10/spaced-reading.html">Spaced, repeated reading</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Input over grammar</h2>
<p>In other words, time spent reading <em>Syriac</em> will be more effective than time spent reading <em>about</em> Syriac.</p>
<p>As long as what I'm reading is qualifies as <em>comprehensible input</em> (i.e. at least 95% understandable).</p>
<p>The problem with classical languages is finding material that qualifies as comprehensible.</p>
<p>Since I'm a beginner, my plan is to start by adding the sentences from my text book to an <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> flashcard deck. I'll make sure that I understand the translation of these sentences before I add them.</p>
<p>Because the Syriac writing system is quite different from what I'm used to and has a lot of silent letters. I'm going to include a rough phonetic transcription on the back of each card along with the translation.</p>
<p>Another trick I learned is to bold new vocabulary that you want to learn. This will be more useful after I'm more comfortable reading and don't need a full translation on each card. At that point, I'll stop adding full translations and just note the meaning of the bolded words.</p>
<h2>Cloze grammar cards</h2>
<p>For more details see <a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/05/16/anki-cloze-tables.html">this post</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to use cloze deletions to become more familiar with the paradigms.</p>
<p>These seem to work really well for me to become comfortable with how a paradigm works.</p>
<p>This is in tension with the <code>input over grammar</code> principle above, but I find such <em>familarity</em> to be helpful.</p>
<p>Again, not memorizing to memorize, but familiarity.</p>
<h2>Spaced, repeated reading</h2>
<p>See <a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/2019/06/10/spaced-reading.html">this post</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In short the idea is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> to schedule rereading material that qualifies as comprehensible input.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by using a spaced repetition software.</p>
<p>For me this is Anki.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the cards will simple be the sentences from my textbooks. Once I'm more comfortable, then the cards will probably be links, book + page numbers, or references to the material that I want to read.</p>
<h1>What's next</h1>
<p>As I write other posts about learning Syriac, I'll add links to them here.</p>

                <p>Spaced repetition software is perhaps the most effective way to study using flashcards. The idea is that we review new material right before we forget it, then we wait longer before reviewing it again.</p>
<p>Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>Each review, strengthens the memory.</p>
<h1>Comprehensible input</h1>
<p>Language, though, is learned through interaction with material that is at least ~95% comprehensible, rather than like a collection of facts to memorize. This can happen via reading, listening, conversations etc.</p>
<p>We need a lot of input for the brain to acquire language.</p>
<p>It's simply how the brain works.</p>
<p>For Greek, this means lots of reading (it is a classical language after all), but reading at or near one's current level.</p>
<p>Repeated exposure to comprehensible input, allows out brain to acquire the words and grammar in that input naturally.</p>
<p>But we need <em>repeated</em> exposure.</p>
<p>Could we perhaps combine spaced repetition with reading of comprehensible input to get the needed repetition?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<h1>How to combine them</h1>
<p><em>Here's how I've done this.</em></p>
<p>I have two decks. One for shorter sentences that have words that I specifically want to learn. A second deck that just has the "address" of what I want to read.</p>
<p>In the first deck, I make a card with the sentence I want to review and bold the words I want to learn. Then I put the meanings of the new words on the back of the card.</p>
<p>For the second deck, I make a card that tells me what to read. I don't put anything else on these cards. For example, I have some cards that say <code>I Clem 17</code> (1st Clement, chapter 17) or <code>Rom 6</code> or <code>I Clem 20:1-3</code>.</p>
<p>The second deck takes much more time to review and I need access to the books I'm reading. The first deck I can study on the go or whenever I have a few minutes.</p>
<p>For the second deck, I'd recommend creating cards with smaller chunks of text to read. So instead of a card that says <code>I John 1</code>, you might consider <code>I John 1:1-4</code> and then making other cards for the rest of the chapter.</p>
<p>This means that you don't need as much time to reread the material  and are more likely to keep at it.</p>
<p><em>Of course, you don't need a spaced repetition app to do this.</em> The idea is simply to <em>read and reread</em> the same texts. This let's you learn grammar and vocab in a natural way.</p>
<p>The trouble is finding texts to read that are level appropriate, but that is a can of worms for another post ... or Ph.D. dissertation ;-).</p>

                    <a href="/anki-cloze-cards-for-learning-paradigms.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Anki cloze cards for learning paradigms&quot;">Anki cloze cards for learning paradigms</a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Comprehensible input is the way to go. The research in second language acquisition indicates that consciously memorized knowledge can't morph into facility with a language in the brain. The brain builds its own black-box model of a language through our interaction with it. This process relies on <em>understanding</em> the <em>meaning</em> of what we read or hear, not on understanding the grammar.</p>
<p>In my experience, having familiarity with the paradigms and tables <em>helps</em> figure out what an unfamiliar form in the text it. At least it helps me think through whether this is a new form or a completely new word. This in turns helps make unfamiliar things more understandable. This increasing my ability to understand is the pay off, not the conscious knowledge of the grammar.</p>
<p>Memorizing tables is a pain and is probably not worth too much effort. Familiarity, however, has been helpful to me. The following is a method to use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> (free, SRS flashcard software) and cloze deletion flashcards to help with this process of building familiarity.</p>
<h1>What is a cloze card?</h1>
<p>A cloze card is a flashcard where the piece of information to be learned it blanked out or deleted. This blanked out info is called a "cloze deletion". When studying our task is to recall the missing piece.</p>
<p>Our brain remembers things better if we can form associations between the new information and other things that we know. The more connections, the stronger the memory and the easier the recall.</p>
<p>So instead of trying to memorize and recall a whole paradigm, I propose that we use cloze deletions and blank out only a few pieces of the paradigm.</p>
<p>The advantage is that we are only asking ourselves to recall a few forms at a time. This lowers our stress and makes our minds more open to receiving the information. Also we are seeing the other forms on the table and thus seeing the connections between the current form and the rest of the paradigm.</p>
<p>For example if we wanted to learn or become familiar with the following paradigm:</p>
<h2 id="one"><br></h2>

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: left;"></th><th style="text-align: left;">Masc</th><th style="text-align: left;">Fem</th><th style="text-align: left;">Neut</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;">NOM SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">εῖς</td><td style="text-align: left;">μία</td><td style="text-align: left;">έν</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;">GEN SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενός</td><td style="text-align: left;">μιᾶς</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενός</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;">DAT SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενί</td><td style="text-align: left;">μιᾷ</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενί</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;">ACC SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">ένα</td><td style="text-align: left;">μίαν</td><td style="text-align: left;">έν</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>We could create cloze cards as follows in order to learn the Masc and Neut, NOM SG forms:</p>
<h2 id="one"><br></h2>

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: left;"></th><th style="text-align: left;">Masc</th><th style="text-align: left;">Fem</th><th style="text-align: left;">Neut</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;">NOM SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">[...]</td><td style="text-align: left;">μία</td><td style="text-align: left;">[...]</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;">GEN SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενός</td><td style="text-align: left;">μιᾶς</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενός</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;">DAT SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενί</td><td style="text-align: left;">μιᾷ</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενί</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;">ACC SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">ένα</td><td style="text-align: left;">μίαν</td><td style="text-align: left;">έν</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Then the following could be used for the Masc and Neut Gen SG forms:</p>
<h2 id="one"><br></h2>

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: left;"></th><th style="text-align: left;">Masc</th><th style="text-align: left;">Fem</th><th style="text-align: left;">Neut</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;">NOM SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">εῖς</td><td style="text-align: left;">μία</td><td style="text-align: left;">έν</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;">GEN SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">[...]</td><td style="text-align: left;">μιᾶς</td><td style="text-align: left;">[...]</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;">DAT SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενί</td><td style="text-align: left;">μιᾷ</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενί</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;">ACC SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">ένα</td><td style="text-align: left;">μίαν</td><td style="text-align: left;">έν</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>And the following to learn the Fem, Gen SG form:</p>
<h2 id="one"><br></h2>

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: left;"></th><th style="text-align: left;">Masc</th><th style="text-align: left;">Fem</th><th style="text-align: left;">Neut</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;">NOM SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">εῖς</td><td style="text-align: left;">[...]</td><td style="text-align: left;">έν</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;">GEN SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενός</td><td style="text-align: left;">μιᾶς</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενός</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;">DAT SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενί</td><td style="text-align: left;">μιᾷ</td><td style="text-align: left;">ενί</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: left;">ACC SG</td><td style="text-align: left;">ένα</td><td style="text-align: left;">μίαν</td><td style="text-align: left;">έν</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>We could proceed by adding cloze deletions for the other pieces of the paradigm that we want to recall. Note that it may not be necessary to create a cloze deletion for every piece of the table. Remember that the goal is familiarity.</p>
<h1>Creating tables in Anki</h1>
<p>Anki includes a cloze deletion card type. The trick is the table. You can either use spaces or tabs to format the table manually or you can use HTML.</p>
<h2>Spaces and tabs</h2>
<p>Spaces and tables would be the simplest, but the result may not look as nice. You have to manually line up the columns. I the result would be as follows.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>       <span class="n">Masc</span> <span class="n">Fem</span>  <span class="n">Neut</span>
<span class="n">NOM</span> <span class="n">SG</span> <span class="err">εῖς</span>  <span class="err">μία</span>     <span class="err">έν</span>
<span class="n">GEN</span> <span class="n">SG</span> <span class="err">ενός</span> <span class="err">μιᾶς</span> <span class="err">ενός</span>
<span class="n">DAT</span> <span class="n">SG</span> <span class="err">ενί</span>  <span class="err">μιᾷ</span>    <span class="err">ενί</span>
<span class="n">ACC</span> <span class="n">SG</span> <span class="err">ένα</span>  <span class="err">μίαν</span> <span class="err">έν</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>HTML tables</h2>
<p>The following instruction assume you are using the Desktop version of Anki to create the cards. Once you sync your collection to your phone, you can view the html tables there too.</p>
<p>Either you have to write the HTML manually, or you can use an HTML table generator such as <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">tablesgenerator.com</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have your html code, click <code>Add</code> to add a card. Select the cloze card type. Then click on the field under the label <code>Text</code>. After that, click on the three horizontal bars on the right size of the formatting bar. After that select <code>Edit HTML</code> or hit <code>CTRL + SHIFT + X</code> then paste the html code into the pop-up and click <code>close</code>.</p>
<h1>Creating the cloze deletions</h1>
<p>The following assume the desktop app, but the process is very similar for creating cloze deletions on the mobile apps.</p>
<p>To create a cloze deletion, you first select the text you want to turn into recall and click on the button <code>[...]</code> button on the format bar or hit <code>CTRL + SHIFT + C</code>. This will wrap the info in a cloze code that looks like <code>{{c1::info to be learned}}</code>.</p>
<p>You can create multiple cloze deletions per card. <code>c1</code> will be the first, then <code>c2</code> will be the second, and so forth.</p>
<p>If you want to have multiple pieces of the table blanked out at the same time, edit the number following the <code>c</code> so they that they are the same. For example, if I wanted 'εν' and 'λογος' to be cloze deletions at the same time, I need to manually edit the number following the <code>c</code> so that it looks like <code>{{c1::εν}} αρχη ην {{c1::ο λογος}}</code>.</p>
<h1>Final thoughts</h1>
<p>Should creating and studying flashcard in Anki replace other learning activities that focus on comprehensible input? No. But they might be a useful parallel activity.</p>

                <p>One of the problems facing learners of Ancient is getting used to the cases of nouns. Below is a simple input task that can be used to introduce new vocabulary. Students are given an item and a card with the name of that item. They are then asked to find out what other students have and if the other students like that item.</p>
<p>This will allow students to expand their vocabulary as well as encounter that vocabulary in both nominative and accusative case. This should work for nouns, some participles, and adjectives if used in conjunction with a noun.</p>
<h1>Prep</h1>
<ul>
<li>Find props, pictures, or other realia that represents the words to be learned.</li>
<li>Create a card that has the Greek word for that object. Make sure to include the article and/or genitive singular of the word so that students can correctly identify what gender it belongs to.<ul>
<li>It may also be necessary to give the accusative case depending on students facility in conjugating the given declension.</li>
<li>If students are beginners, it may help to give them the sentences they will need to complete this activity (see "Language needed for this activity" below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Setup</h1>
<ul>
<li>Divide students into groups if necessary. Ideally one or two vocabulary items per student.</li>
<li>Give students a prop and a card with the new vocabulary item.</li>
<li>Tell students that they need to learn the name of each object/picture/etc. in their group and whether the person likes it because they will be asked to tell the class this information.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Wrap up</h1>
<p>After students have found the information, the teacher can pick students from the group to tell the class the objects and if the other student liked the item. This also provides a chance to the teacher to repeat the basic questions "τι έχει ...?" and "ᾶρα αυτῄῳ αρέσει ο/η/τό ___?".  </p>
<h1>Language needed for this activity</h1>
<ul>
<li>τι έχεις?</li>
<li>έχω (ένα/μίαν/έν) ___.</li>
<li>ᾶρα σοι αρέσει ο/η/τό ___</li>
<li>μοι (ου) αρέσει ο/η/τό __</li>
<li>έχει ο/η name-of-student ___.</li>
<li>αυτῳ/αυτῃ αρέσει ο/η/τό ___</li>

                <p>Ancient/Koine Greek is nothing if not inflected. It is also quite irregular. This is a pain for students because of the many, many forms a given word can take.</p>
<p>One principle of modern language teaching is to "limit" or "shelter" vocabulary. In other words, don't use too many new words in the course of a lesson and don't teach too many words in the course. The corollary to this is usually not to limit grammar. Thus while students may only hear a small number of new words, they hear normal (complex) grammar.</p>
<h1>The problem</h1>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/mark-rasmuson.jpg"></p>
<p>In my Koine Greek class I have tried to limit the number of vocabulary items. I only add a few new words per lesson, but these words are drawn from each gender: masculine, feminine, and neuter. This gives students a chance to acquire the different declensions and the definite article that goes with them. The trouble is that some of these (quite common) words have stem changes and this adds to what my students have to deal with. Even though this kind of suppletion is common in Greek, I think it is overwhelming for my students.</p>
<h1>The solution &ndash; maybe</h1>
<p>I have been listening to <a href="http://www.teawithbvp.com/">Tea with BVP</a> and their new podcast <a href="https://www.classroomtapas.com/talkinl2">Talkin' L2 with BVP</a>. Bill VanPatten (i.e. BVP) notes that paradigms aren't psychologically real. In other words, they don't exist in students' brains. Instead, each form is acquired as a separate word and only after a lot of acquisition has already happened are connections made between forms. BVP also notes that when students want to produce a new form, their brain strips the ending off a word in their mental lexicon and applies it to create the new form (again, no paradigms).</p>
<p><em>Thinking about this brought me to the realization that I need to consider each form a word to be a separate word for the purpose of limiting vocabulary.</em></p>
<h1>What does this mean?</h1>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/cynthiadelrio.jpg"></p>
<p>I don't think that this means that I should only introduce three to four forms if one word per lesson. I'd never get anywhere with my students. Rather, I should try to introduce words from the same declension so that students don't have to juggle too many new patterns per lesson. This will help expose them to the same kinds of words and hopefully provide the examples and repetition they need to learn the words and make connection between their various forms.</p>
<p>In upcoming lessons, I will focus introduce words from the same declension (as much as possible). If these words have a stem change, then I may lower the number of new vocabulary items for that lesson and focus on repetitions of the forms with the stem change.</p>
<p>My hope is that by considering different forms as separate words and by drawing new vocabulary from the same declension, I can reduce the cognitive overwhelm and increate the ease and speed with which my students acquire new vocabulary and grammar.</p>

<h1>Basic Grammars</h1>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Mounce</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">William</span> <span class="n">D</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="mi">2009</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Basics</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">Biblical</span> <span class="n">Greek</span> <span class="n">Grammar</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="n">rd</span> <span class="n">Ed</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Grand</span> <span class="n">Rapids</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Zondervan</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Mounce's book is what my first Greek class used. There may be other books out there that are better, but I'm fond of this one and would recommend it as an introduction.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Betts</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Gavin</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="mi">2004</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Teach</span> <span class="n">Yourself</span> <span class="n">Ancient</span> <span class="n">Greek</span> <span class="n">Complete</span> <span class="n">Course</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="n">nd</span> <span class="n">Ed</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Blacklick</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">McGraw</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Hill</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I've fiddled with this book. It's not too hard, but it <em>dumps</em> new vocabulary on you by the train car load and thus brings a huge memorization load. It does have lots of examples from a variety of sources, some of which are longer form content &ndash; which I like. it might be better to work through something else first through. I can't really say, though, because I had already used Mounce's book before I got this one. Hopefully, I'll work all the way through it one of these days.</p>

<p>I have not used this book (available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Read-New-Testament-Greek/dp/0805444939">here</a>), but Black is one of the pioneers in bringing the insights of modern linguistics to Koine Greek studies &ndash; at least from my perspective. I would like to look through it one day. And though I have not read it, I would recommend it based on the reputation of its author.</p>

<p><em>You need read this at some point.</em></p>
<p>This is my favorite Greek book because it explains how Koine Greek communicates. Unlike other grammars, it doesn't focus the nuts and bolts of verbs or the case system, rather this books explores how Greek forms larger unites of thought. As readers of Koine Greek, our ultimate goal is to understand what the author is trying to say, how it is being said, and what he/she is trying to emphasize. This book unlocks these aspect of the language.</p>
<p>I also love it because Runge's book sits at the crossroads of Koine Greek studies and <a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/discourse-analysis-what-speakers-do-conversation">discourse analysis</a>. I think that it is one of many books that we are seeing and will see in the future that take insights from the field of linguistics and applies them to Koine Greek. Runge takes linguistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_analysis">discourse analysis</a> and applies it to Koine Greek in a way that is easy to understand &ndash; even if you aren't a linguist. He uses lots of examples and works through them so you can how the ideas he is talking about work out in practice.</p>

<p>The University of Texas at Arlington has online courses (or lessons) that introduce many ancient languages including Classical and Koine Greek. I have looked at them before, though I have never worked through them all the way. I am noting them here for reference. Both the Classical and Koine Greek course provide an overview of the language and some lessons based on Greek texts.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>After years of working with and learning languages, I realized something. It's nothing profound, but it's something to keep in mind when approaching a new language.</p>
<p><em>Put simply, each language provides resources of grammar and vocabulary to its speakers that they can use to communicate their intended meaning.</em></p>
<p>This is a shift in viewpoint about what grammar is and what is does for us. Rather than being a horrible obstacle in the road of language learning, it's another resource that we can use to help us communicate.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Some languages have complex grammar &ndash; verbs have many forms and tenses, nouns change form based on their function in the sentence, etc. Such a language allows speakers to rely on the grammar to communicate a lot of things for which English would use word order or intonation.</p>
<p>Some have huge vocabularies so speakers can choose between different words to communicate fine shades of meaning (e.g. English). Others don't so speakers need to use combinations of words to express these same meanings (i.e. <em>very very large</em> vs. <em>colossal</em>).</p>
<p>Some languages have a fine-grained tense system. Take the English sentence, "By October, it will have been going on for three months". This sentence describes a point in the future in which a certain state will have already existed for three months and is most likely ongoing at that future point. So this sentence describes a past that is yet future. Complex huh? The grammar of English allows us to convey a fairly complex idea with paucity of words.</p>
<p>In Indonesian, there is an adversative verb form that means that something undesirable has happened. For example, compare <em>ter-tinggal</em>, which means 'left behind', with <em>ke-tinggal-an</em>, which means 'left behind accidently'. By changing the beginning and ending of the verb, a precise shade of meaning can be communicated. The grammar of Indonesian offers this grammatical form as a communication resource to its speakers.</p>
<p>Malay languages don't often have gendered pronouns. This means that the word for he/she in these languages doesn't specify whether the person or thing referred to is male, female, or otherwise. This caused trouble for me when I was invited to a birthday party. I thought the child was a girl and couldn't tell from the child's name. It turned out he was a boy and the Barbie doll I brought was not the right present. Oops.</p>
<h1>In sum</h1>
<p>Grammar and vocabulary are resources that a language provides to it's speakers as a means to communicate. They provide the tools to make jokes, debate politics, create literature, and just shoot the breeze.</p>
<p>So next time you are facing a language with complex grammar, don't view it as a obstacle or drudgery, but as one of the resources that the language provides so you can convey your message. Sometimes the resources are quite subtle, but they can open up new ways to communicate that might not be possible in your native language.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>What if I told you that a simple, still image can be all you need to create a mnemonic with real sticking power?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/daniel-hjalmarsson-597537-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p>You might think that's nuts. You've probably heard that mental images need to be bright, colorful, crazy, perhaps obscene, and fully of action. While I agree that this can work for some people, I don't believe that it is necessary &ndash; or even the most effective &ndash; for everyone.</p>
<p>I am a mnemonist for whom complicated, action filled images don't work. If you feel overwhelmed by having to invent action filled stories for each thing you want to memorize, let me propose an alternative for your consideration that I learned about through Swedish author, teacher, and Grand Master of Memory <a href="http://www.grandmasterofmemory.com/">Mattias Ribbing</a>.  </p>
<p>I listened to everything of Ribbing's that I could find and finally decided to learn to read Swedish so I could read his books. This post is primarily based on his book <a href="https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/vagen-till-mastarminne-forandra-ditt-liv-med-kraftfull-minnestraning-9789172322646"><em>The Way to a Master Memory</em></a>.</p>
<h1>Characteristic of a memory friendly image</h1>
<p>The core of many memory techniques is converting information into an image. Ribbing has his own take on how to do this based on the <a href="http://www.sevensigma.info/articles/4memory.html">Giordano Memory System</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/art-close-up-comic-16516.jpg"></p>
<p>He begins with the principle that we can't memorize things in isolation, rather they they need to be connected. So visualizing one image by itself is not helpful. We need to create couplings of images that touch, sit on, or even pierce each other in some way. If you are memorizing texts or foreign language vocabulary, then connecting images makes things easier anyway.</p>
<p>Ribbing says "To be able to quickly create good couplings [of images], we need to to visualize <em>memory-friendly images</em>" (clarification added). He sets forth the following criteria for what qualifies as a memory-friendly image:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This means images of physical objects that we can see in front of us in the room, big, in color, three-dimensional and detailed. The images must also have contours that clearly delimit them from the environment (Ribbing 2011, <em>translation mine</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also adds that we should use the first image that comes to mind that fulfills these criteria. Finally, that image should be <em>still</em>.</p>
<p>If this sounds like a lot, that's ok. It becomes nearly automatic with practice.</p>
<h2>The principles</h2>
<p>I have rephrased his criteria so that they can be remembered with the phrase "TeDDy'S CaFe." Imagine Winnie the Pooh having a coffee in Starbucks or your café of choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's <em><strong>T</strong>hree dimensional</em>, not flat</li>
<li>It's <em><strong>D</strong>istinct</em> and has clear contours (sharp angles are a bonus too)</li>
<li>It's <em><strong>D</strong>etailed</em></li>
<li>It's <em><strong>S</strong>till</em></li>
<li>it's <em>in <strong>C</strong>olor</em></li>
<li>It's the <em><strong>F</strong>irst image I think up</em> that has the above characteristics</li>
</ul>
<p>The image below is the size of an index card and can be printed and kept with you as a reminder of these principles (a PDF is available <a href="/images/TeDDy_CaFe.pdf">here</a>)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/TeDDy_CaFe.png"></p>
<p>Two final points from Ribbing and my own experience:</p>
<p><strong>Try to imagine the image in front of you taking up space.</strong> This takes some practice but I think it pays off. I often look to where various parts of it would be if it were really in front of me. Ribbing has said in some of his talks that this helps (find out more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFtPOUx7Hk">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e9PxI66tyI">here</a>). I agree.</p>
<p><strong>When you visualize an image, take a few seconds to really see it. Notice what details that your mind provides.</strong> Even if you just imagine a book, your brain is probably thinking of a specific book. So take the time to see what book you are seeing in your mind. Chronicles of Narnia? Lord of the Rings? Oxford English Dictionary?</p>
<p>For example, I wanted to use a knight to remember England (I was memorizing World Cup wins at the time). As I paid attention to the details, I realized that I was imagining a crusader knight with a red cross and white tunic over his armor. These details make the image "sticky" mentally.</p>
<h1>Encoding techniques</h1>
<p>Thinking up images can be challenging when we first begin. Ribbing describes three kinds of encoding strategies that we can use to convert information to images. I don't consciously think "Oh, I'm using a symbolic encoding right now," but knowing that these three techniques are solid strategies can give direction when you don't know how to encode something. They can also give you assurance that you are doing things the right way when you have doubts. Doubt is something I think we all experience when learning memory techinques.</p>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consonance encoding (<em>A</em> sounds like <em>B</em>)</li>
<li>Symbolic encoding (<em>A</em> is closely associated with <em>B</em>)</li>
<li>Experiential encoding (<em>A</em> relates to <em>B</em> in my personal experience)</li>

<h2>Consonance encoding</h2>
<p>With <strong>consonance encoding</strong> (think rhyming) we use a similar sounding word to encode the information we want to memorize. Ribbing notes that this is especially useful for learning foreign language vocabulary.</p>
<p>For example, to learn the Spanish word <em>casa</em> 'house', we might use the English word <em>cash</em> to help remember the pronunciation. So our mental image would be a house made out of cash.  </p>
<h2>Symbolic encoding</h2>
<p>With this kind of encoding we use a symbol to encode the new information. For example, a heart is often used as a symbol for "love". A flag could be used in place of the country it represents. The idea is to use something closely associated with thing to be remembered as a replacement/stand in for it.</p>
<h2>Experiential encoding</h2>
<p>With experiential encoding we encode information using a personal connection. For example, I memorized the word <em>Benjaminite</em> by using an baby blue electric guitar because a good friend of mine whose middle name is Benjamin plays a baby blue Fender.</p>
<p>To use this technique find something from your experience that helps you remember the new information.</p>
<p>Regardless of the technique you choose, the image you create should follow the "TeDDy'S CaFe" principles.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Many memory technique teachers recommend using bright, action-filled stories to convert information into something that can stick in long-term memory. However, that's not the case for all memory teachers. I personally find creating such images difficult and that all the action makes them hard to visualize.  </p>
<p>I prefer to use "TeDDy'S CaFe" style images. I find them less stressful to work with and more effective for me. When looking for images, we can encode information using one of three time tested teqniques: rhyming, symbolic association, or by using something from our own experience.</p>
<p>No matter where you come down on action filled or still images, the other principles of what makes a memory-friendly (mnemonic) image will help you strengthen your skills as a mnemonist, help you memorize things faster, and remember them for longer.</p>
<p>Happy memorizing!</p>
