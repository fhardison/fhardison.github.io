For the last few weeks I've been working on Koine Greek readers illustrated with Legos. I suppose they are inspired by _Lingua Latina per se illustrata_. I'm making the source text and images available at [https://github.com/fhardison/koine-greek-readers](https://github.com/fhardison/koine-greek-readers).

I'm not the best at accent rules yet so most of the words do not have accents. I hope to improve this as I go.
