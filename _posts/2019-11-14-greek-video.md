Here's my first shot a making a video about the pronunciation I use for Koine Greek. I'm sure I butcher accents and stumble over plenty of words. But here it is anyway. It uses some vocab that I found reading Dionysis Thrax's [Τέχνη Γραμματική](https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A4%CE%AD%CF%87%CE%BD%CE%B7_%CE%93%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE) (Art of Grammar??).

`ἀποτελεῖ` 'it produces' was interesting to me as it is used to talk about the sound a letter makes.
