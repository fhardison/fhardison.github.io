Recently I've wanted to read some Ancient Greek texts with some additional helps as my currently fluency level requires some support to reach these texts. I've created a few repos that have Alpheios reading tools added and a diglot or two (one is even sentence aligned). Here are the links:

* [Some Ancient Greek grammars](https://amindforlanguage.com/thrax_grammar/)
    - Art of Grammar by Dionysios Thrax
    - 4 works by Apollonius Dyscolus
* [Anabasis, Book 1 (Diglot with Alpheios](https://amindforlanguage.com/anabasis/)
* [Argonautica, Book 1 with Alpheios](https://amindforlanguage.com/argonautica/)
