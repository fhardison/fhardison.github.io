One of the problems facing learners of Ancient is getting used to the cases of nouns. Below is a simple input task that can be used to introduce new vocabulary. Students are given an item and a card with the name of that item. They are then asked to find out what other students have and if the other students like that item.

This will allow students to expand their vocabulary as well as encounter that vocabulary in both nominative and accusative case. This should work for nouns, some participles, and adjectives if used in conjunction with a noun.

# Prep

* Find props, pictures, or other realia that represents the words to be learned.
* Create a card that has the Greek word for that object. Make sure to include the article and/or genitive singular of the word so that students can correctly identify what gender it belongs to.
	* It may also be necessary to give the accusative case depending on students facility in conjugating the given declension.
	* If students are beginners, it may help to give them the sentences they will need to complete this activity (see "Language needed for this activity" below).

# Setup

* Divide students into groups if necessary. Ideally one or two vocabulary items per student.
* Give students a prop and a card with the new vocabulary item.
* Tell students that they need to learn the name of each object/picture/etc. in their group and whether the person likes it because they will be asked to tell the class this information.

# Wrap up

After students have found the information, the teacher can pick students from the group to tell the class the objects and if the other student liked the item. This also provides a chance to the teacher to repeat the basic questions "τι έχει ...?" and "ᾶρα αυτῄῳ αρέσει ο/η/τό ___?".
