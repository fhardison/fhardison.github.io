                <p>I wrote this a while back as a funny mnemonic to help remember Greek 3rd (or consonant) declension endings. Enjoy.</p>
<hr>
<p>Once there was a man named <em>Sydney</em> (ς) who was very fond of <em>Women</em> and felt threatened by other men so that he had his poor dog <em>Neutered</em> so there was <em>No Chance</em> (-) of the dog getting in his way. Sydney and his dog were very fond of devices with Apple <em>OS</em> (-ος, -ος) such that his dog had his own iPhone. They would set together on their <em>iPhones</em> (-ι) watching <em>ET</em> (-ι). One day Sydney had an <em>AHA</em> (-α) moment and realized his life was going  <em>Nowhere</em> (-).</p>
<p>So he went to <em>Express</em> (-ες) and bought some new clothes to make himself very <em>Attractive</em> (-α). Now that he <em>Owned</em> (-ων) new clothes he thought it was a <em>Sin</em> (-σιν) to go out in the old ones so he gave them to his neighbor who was an <em>Attractive</em> (-α) <em>Astrologer</em> (-ας).</p>
