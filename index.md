Welcome to A Mind for Language.

I'm a teacher, translator, writer, and linguist. I love reading, learning, and sharing what I've learned. On the blog, you'll find my thoughts on languages, language learning, memory techniques, and other things I've been learning or find interesting. I thrive on learning new things and want to be a blessing to others. This is just one way I do that.

# About


I've got a B.A. and M.A. in linguistics so I'm a thinker, a reader, and a writer. It also means I know how to communicate. Linguistics prefers terse, clear, and down-to-earth prose. No need for fluff. We ain't got no time for that anyway.

I love to read and to share what I've learned with others. Learning new things keeps me motivated and excited. I've learned Search Engine Optimization (SEO), memory techniques, and multiple programming languages without the benefit of formal classes. I also regularly write a email newsletter to keep donors and interested parties engaged in the work of a non-profit.

## Education

* B.A. Applied Linguistics - Moody Bible Institute, 2009
* M.A. Linguistics - University of North Dakota, 2013

## Interests

* Language learning and teaching
* Memory techniques
* Learning techniques
* Programming and computers
* Diet and Exercise
* Reading (non-fiction, fantasy, sci-fi, just to name a few)
* Open source authoring tools (markdown, Pandoc, etc)
