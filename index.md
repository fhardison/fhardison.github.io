Welcome to A Mind for Language.

I love reading, learning, and sharing what I've learned. On the blog, you'll find my thoughts on languages, language learning, memory techniques, and other things I've been learning or find interesting. I thrive on learning new things and want to be a blessing to others. This is just one way I do that.
