<h2>How I started learning Greek</h2>
<h3 class="date">2023-04-19</h3>
</section>
<section>
<p>I began learning Koine Greek from a book when I was 16 or so
(2004-2005).</p>
<p>I made little progress.</p>
<p><strong>Then, I audited in a seminary class, that used that same
book. I was homeschooled and had the freedom to do stuff like that.
Don't judge.</strong></p>
<p>It was a traditional grammar/translation class with lots of
memorization and decoding.</p>
<p><em>Not what I'd recommend today.</em></p>
<p>I think I got around a 90 for my grade and liked it a lot better than
the Spanish I'd had in elementary school.</p>
<p>I took another semester.</p>
<p><strong>These classes gave me an overview of Greek and some common
vocab.</strong></p>
<p>But, they didn't give me a language learning strategy or tools
besides flashcards.</p>
<p>After that I didn't take another Greek class until college when I
took Greek 1 distance ed to knock out a requirement so I could graduate
sooner. I had taken some general linguistics, which I applied to my
studies, but really didn't learn much.</p>
<p><strong>After that I focused on modern languages and linguistics
research, so Greek sat on the shelf until 2016 when it became part of my
work life.</strong></p>
<p>Then I got serious.</p>
<p><strong>I had learned about memory palaces and so I applied them to
Metzger's <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/682341">Lexical Aids for
Students of New Testament Greek</a> and tried to memorize
vocab.</strong></p>
<p>It helped somewhat, but I still forget the distinction between
prefixed verbs like πρόσεχω and σύνεχω. I think this was mostly a waste
of time, but at least I was doing something.</p>
<p><strong>The big thing is that I read a fair bit of Greek and looked
up grammar as needed so I was getting comprehensible input (CI) during
this time.</strong></p>
<p>The grammar I read helped make things more comprehensible.</p>
<p><strong>Other things that happened during this period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I started reading some Greek linguistics (like <a
href="https://www.logos.com/product/4599/discourse-grammar-of-the-greek-new-testament-a-practical-introduction-for-teaching-and-exegesis">Rouse</a>,
<a
href="https://www.logos.com/product/129137/linguistics-and-biblical-exegesis">Aubrey
et al.</a>)</li>
<li>I found <a href="https://jktauber.com/">James Tauber</a> and <a
href="https://thepatrologist.com/">Seumas Macdonald</a>’s work</li>
<li>I read Athanaze vol. 1-2 and started JACT's <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Greek-Association-Classical-Teachers/dp/0521698510">Reading
Greek</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(I bought the JACT book on Kindle. Not a good format for it.)</p>
<p>More CI.</p>
<p><strong>I took a few classes with Seumas and even taught a Greek
class for free to acquaintances interested in studying using
comprehension focused methods.</strong></p>
<p>More CI.</p>
<p><strong>I tried to read texts outside the GNT, like the church
fathers, and got involved in digitizing Greek texts with the <a
href="https://greek-learner-texts.org/">Greek Leaner Texts
Project</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Kind of funny that I was trying to lemmatize texts that I couldn't
read, but I have some programming skills and wanted to make these texts
more comprehensible so I <em>could eventually</em> read them.</p>
<p>What about now?</p>
<p><strong>Now, I focus on reading.</strong></p>
<p>I read GNT and LXX. Sometimes I listen to audio while I read,
sometimes not. I want to read Homer and other classical texts.</p>
<p>I also write and try to figure out how to say things for classes I'm
teaching.</p>
<p>My Greek journey started in the traditional way, but it was the CI
bits that built confidence and skill. The most useful grammar studies
happened along the way as I worked with texts or tried to figure out how
to say (or write) something.</p>
