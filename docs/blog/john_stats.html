<h1>Exploring John’s vocabulary vs the rest of the GNT</h1>

<p>I’ve been considering the virtues of a NT Greek textbook oriented
around reading John’s Gospel. Clyde Pharr’s Homeric Greek textbook
(Pharr 1929) is built around reading Iliad, Book 1 and I think this has
some really helpful features.</p>
<p>The main advantage is that the exercises and readings all center
around a real text to be read and thus maintain a coherent storyline and
set of vocabulary. This approach is skewed in that it teaches for a
particular book, but in my mind the tradeoff is worth it.</p>
<p>That said I was wondering how the how many of the GNT lemmas one
would encounter reading John. In other words, how skewed would such an
approach be. So I clobbed together some code using James Tauber’s
<code>vocabulary tools</code><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"

<h2 id="the-numbers">The numbers</h2>
<p>The table below shows some basic stats about the words and lemmas in
John and the GNT.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"

<p>After learning John’s lemmas a learner would know 18.29% of the GNT’s
unique lemmas. Which is not so great.</p>
<p>The picture changes if we look at what percentage of the total words
in the GNT are occurrences of the lemmas in John.</p>
<p>The lemmas that occur in John cover 85.82% of the total of 137,554
lemmas that occur in the GNT. That’s not too shabby.</p>
<p>So after reading John, assuming a learner has a perfect memory, they
should be able to read 85.82% of the words they encounter in the rest of
the GNT.</p>
<p>But what about word forms? How many of the forms of words would a
reader encounter in John?</p>
<p>By reading John a reader would encounter 14.64% of the unique forms
found in the GNT. But these forms account for 74.63% of the 137,554
forms that occur in the GNT.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>By taking these two percentages of lemmas and forms vs total
occurrences in the GNT, it seems that John’s Gospel has a reasonable
amount of high frequency vocabulary and grammar. It seems that a learner
would be in a good place after reading John’s Gospel from whence to
explore the rest of the GNT, especially with the help of a reader’s
edition.</p>
<p>To me this shows that a NT Greek textbook oriented around reading
John’s Gospel would be plausible and valuable for students.</p>
