<p>Hi friend,</p>
<p>I’ve been somewhat enamored of memory techniques ever since learning
about the method of loci or the memory palace. Perhaps because
memorization hasn’t come easy to me. At least not intentionally.</p>
<p>I have a book called <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Maths-Unwrapped-Mattias-Ribbing/dp/1473696127">Maths
Unwrapped</a> by Mattias Ribbing and Per Sundin. It teaches math using
memory techniques and I thought, “This is great. I bet I could do this
for Greek” which then led to doing it for Latin which I’m currently
trying to learn so I can tutor it in the Fall.</p>
<p>The whole approach is to take concepts and tie them to simple,
“Memory friendly images” as Ribbing says. This gives our brains
something to tie the knowledge to and so we can recall it on command
more easily.</p>
<p>The problem for Latin and Greek is that we need to tie lots of little
images together. It’s not enough to understand that Nominative case is
used for the subject of a sentence, but we also need to memorize what
endings mark the Nominative case.</p>
<p>There are various techniques to combine all this information and I’m
currently experimenting on what works best for me and hopefully for
others too. So, look for future posts with details.</p>
