      <description>Hi friend,
I&amp;rsquo;ve been somewhat enamored of memory techniques ever since learning about the method of loci or the memory palace. Perhaps because memorization hasn&amp;rsquo;t come easy to me. At least not intentionally.
I have a book called Maths Unwrapped by Mattias Ribbing and Per Sundin. It teaches math using memory techniques and I thought, &amp;ldquo;This is great. I bet I could do this for Greek&amp;rdquo; which then led to doing it for Latin which I&amp;rsquo;m currently trying to learn so I can tutor it in the Fall.</description>
