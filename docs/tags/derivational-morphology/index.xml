      <description>In the last post we discussed noun forming morphology. This post focuses on morphemes that form verbs.
There are 28,056 verbs in the GNT that represent 1,853 lexical items. Of these, 425 only occur once.
The table below shows how many lexical items in the GNT are formed using a given suffix and how many times that verb occurs in the GNT.
Suffix Lemmas Occurrences Hapax

      <description>You open to your current reading project and you encounter a new word. What do you do if:
the word isn&amp;rsquo;t footnoted? or if your reading online reading tools can&amp;rsquo;t find it? Enter derivational morphology.
Derivational morphemes are the parts of words that form the word and don&amp;rsquo;t change based on its function in an utterance. Often adding a derivational morpheme will change the part of speech of the word (like -er in English).</description>
