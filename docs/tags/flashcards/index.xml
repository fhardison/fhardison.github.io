      <description>This is how I made my Anki setup 1,000% more effective.
Ok, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know if 1,000% is accurate, but it certainly works significantly better than it did.
Words stick more easily, and it&amp;rsquo;s more fun.
The only downside is that cards take more time to create, but the payoff is worth it.
The key is the note setup.
Anki lets us customize notes and how they are transformed into cards.</description>
