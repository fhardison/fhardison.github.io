    <p>You open to your current reading project and you encounter a new
word. What do you do if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the word isn’t footnoted?</li>
<li>or if your reading online reading tools can’t find it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter derivational morphology.</p>
<p>Derivational morphemes are the parts of words that form the word and
don’t change based on its function in an utterance. Often adding a
derivational morpheme will change the part of speech of the word (like
<em>-er</em> in English).</p>

<h2>Knowing some derivational morphology and what it means can help us
guess the meaning of words in context.</h2>
<p>In other words, this knowledge can help us increase the
comprehensibility of a text without having to resort to lexicons or
reading tools.</p>
<p>This post will focus on Greek nouns in the SBL Greek New
Testament.</p>

<h2>Greek has many noun-forming derivational morphemes, but there are a
few that are high frequency in the Greek New Testament.</h2>
<p>The following data was generated by taking the list of derivational
suffixes from <a
href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Ancient_Greek_noun-forming_suffixes">Wikitionary</a>
and then checking which words in the nouns SBLGNT ended with that
suffix.</p>

<section
id="the-stats-tell-us-why-its-worth-bothering-derivational-morphemes."
class="level2">
<h2>The stats tell us why it’s worth bothering derivational
morphemes.</h2>
<p>There are 2399 noun lemmas in the SBLGNT and there are 28,237
occurrences of those nouns. The first four suffixes in the list below
account for 685 noun lemmas and occur 5,504 times. Thus being aware of
these suffixes and their meaning can help the student guess around 25%
of the lemmas they are likely to encounter and about 20% of the
nouns.</p>
<p>Of the 2,399 nouns, 969 occur only once. These first four suffixes
account for 287 of them. Thus derivational morphology gives us the tools
to guess at the meaning of about a quarter of the hapaxlegomena in the
GNT.</p>

<h2>Here’s a list of higher frequency derivational morphemes that are
worth your time to learn as you’re studying New Testament Greek.</h2>
<p>In the list below the two numbers at the end are the number of words
formed with this suffix and how many times those words occur in the GNT.
Clicking on the suffix will take you to the Wiktionary entry for it.</p>
