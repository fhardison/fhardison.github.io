    <p>This is how I made my Anki setup 1,000% more effective.</p>
<p>Ok, I don’t actually know if 1,000% is accurate, but it certainly
works significantly better than it did.</p>
<p>Words stick more easily, and it’s more fun.</p>
<p>The only downside is that cards take more time to create, but the
payoff is worth it.</p>
<p><em>The key is the note setup.</em></p>
<p>Anki lets us customize notes and how they are transformed into cards.
This means that I can fill in the relevant data for a word and then Anki
does the rest.</p>
<p><em>In this case I have 5 fields on my notes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>word</li>
<li>meaning</li>
<li>picture</li>
<li>audio</li>
<li>personal connection (which I often don’t use)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Then I have Anki setup to create 3 cards:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Card 1:
<ul>
<li>Front: Word + audio + input box for meaning</li>
<li>Back: meaning + image + personal connection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Card 2:
<ul>
<li>Front: Image + input box for word</li>
<li>Back: word + audio + meaning + personal connection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Card 3:
<ul>
<li>Front: Audio + input box for meaning</li>
<li>Back: word + image + meaning + personal connection</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I found this setup from [Josh Muller’s
post](https://joshmuller.ca/writings/2022/koine-greek-resources/#flashcard-software
and added the input boxes after staring to use <a
href="https://biblingo.org/">Biblingo</a> to increase the level of
active recall required. Biblingo has input boxes and I typing in the
answer has been beneficial so I tried to duplicate it in Anki.</p>
<p><strong>Active recall is the key here.</strong></p>
<p>This setup requires active recall of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Word (audio, text) -&gt; Meaning</li>
<li>Meaning (image) -&gt; Word</li>
</ul>
<p>Also I’m increasing my personal connection to the words when I create
the cards because I’m searching for an image online that makes sense to
me to represent the meaning of the word.</p>
<p><em>And</em> I record myself saying the word. That saves time, and,
anyway, I’m learning dead languages where native speakers don’t exist
anymore.</p>
