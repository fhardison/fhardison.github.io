<h1>Links to online readers</h1>
<h2>Fletcher Hardison {.subtitle}</h2>
<p>Recently I've wanted to read some Ancient Greek texts with some additional helps as my currently fluency level requires some support to reach these texts. I've created a few repos that have Alpheios reading tools added and a diglot or two (one is even sentence aligned). Here are the links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amindforlanguage.com/thrax_grammar/">Some Ancient Greek grammars</a><ul>
<li>Art of Grammar by Dionysios Thrax</li>
<li>4 works by Apollonius Dyscolus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://amindforlanguage.com/anabasis/">Anabasis, Book 1 (Diglot with Alpheios)</a></li>
</ul>
</body>
