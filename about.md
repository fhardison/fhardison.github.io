Welcome to A Mind for Language.

I'm a translator, teacher, amateur writer, and linguist. I love reading, learning, and tinkering with programming. On the blog, you'll find my thoughts on languages, language learning, memory techniques, and other things I've been learning or find interesting.








I've got a B.A. and M.A. in linguistics so I'm a thinker, a reader, and a writer. I've lived overseas and learned a world language or two. It's a hobby. My main interest now is classical languages and how to learn and teach them more efficiently.

I'm a self-taught programmer and love to fiddle with scripts and ideas to make learning and teaching languages better. Some of the things I've tinkered with are on [GitHub](https://github.com/fhardison) (a lot of these are currently inactive).

Current, active projects I'm involved with include:

* [Grammar and Exercises for Lingua Graecae Per Se Illustrata](https://github.com/fhardison/lgpsi-melethma)
* [Rouse's A Greek Boy at Home](https://github.com/fhardison/rouse-a-greek-boy-at-home)

## Education

* B.A. Applied Linguistics - Moody, 2009
* M.A. Linguistics - University of North Dakota, 2013

## Interests

* Language learning and teaching
* Memory techniques
* Learning techniques
* Programming and computers
* Diet and Exercise
* Culture
* Reading (non-fiction, fantasy, sci-fi, just to name a few)
* Open source authoring tools (markdown, Pandoc, etc)
