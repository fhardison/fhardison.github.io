I've got a B.A. and M.A. in linguistics so I'm a thinker, a reader, and a writer. It also means I know how to communicate. Linguistics prefers terse, clear, and down-to-earth prose. No need for fluff. We ain't got no time for that anyway.

I love to read and to share what I've learned with others. Learning new things keeps me motivated and excited. I've learned Search Engine Optimization (SEO), memory techniques, and multiple programming languages without the benefit of formal classes. I also regularly write a email newsletter to keep donors and interested parties engaged in the work of a non-profit.
